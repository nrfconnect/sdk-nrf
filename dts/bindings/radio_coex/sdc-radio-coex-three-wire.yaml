    This is a representation of an external radio coexistence setup that has a
    three-pin control interface (REQUEST, GRANT, PRIORITY/DIRECTION). This
    extends that interface with additional signal level settings and timing
    parameters.

            Delay in microseconds between the request pin being raised and the

            Delay in microseconds between the PRIORITY pin indicating the type
            of transaction and the radio starting on-air activity.
