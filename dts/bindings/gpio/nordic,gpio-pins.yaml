  This binding allows to assign a GPIO to the domain.
  It does not provide any specific driver.
  The binding enables the following functionalities:

  - Add an entry in UICR that marks the domain to own the selected pin.
  - Allow access to pins using the macros from the `zephyr/devicetree/gpio.h` file,
    which increases the hardware abstraction.
