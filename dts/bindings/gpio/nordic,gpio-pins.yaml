  This allows to define the pin of the GPIO to be owned by the domain.
  It does not provide any specyfic driver.
  Its function is to allow us to use two functionalities:

  1. Generate the right UICR marking the domain to own the selected pin.
  2. Access to pins by the macros from zephyr/devicetree/gpio.h file
     increasing the hardware abstraction this way.
