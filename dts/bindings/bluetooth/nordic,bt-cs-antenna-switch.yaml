  This is an abstract representation of a generic antenna switching circuit
  which is controlled by GPIO pins. Up to four antenna ports (ANT1-4) are defined.

  multiplexing-mode:
    type: int
    description: |
      Multiplexing mode. This setting determines whether or not the switching circuit
      is controlled using a one-to-one mapping between pins and antennas.
      The possible values are:
      0: (default) One-to-one mapping. Each pin selects one antenna.
        Only one pin is active at a time.
      1: Multiplexed mapping. Antenna selection is derived from the state of all
        pins. Example: two pins select between four antennas.

      Array of pins corresponding to <ANT1, ANT2, ANT3, ANT4>.
      At least one pin is needed.
