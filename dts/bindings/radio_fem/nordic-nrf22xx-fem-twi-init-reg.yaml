  This is an abstract device that represents TWI registers of nRF22xx Front-End Module
  to be written at boot-time.

  Here is an example configuration for nRF2240 Front-End Module TWI interface that defines
  initialization registers:

  nrf_radio_fem_twi: fem_twi@30 {
    /* Other properties related to this node go here, including "compatible" and "reg". */
    status = "okay";
      init-regs = <0x11 0xaa>, <0x22 0xbb>, <0x33 0xcc>;
  };

  The above configuration will cause the registers of given nRF22xx device with internal addresses
  0x11, 0x22 and 0x33 to be written with values 0xAA, 0xBB and 0xCC respectively.

  The property is optional. If it is not specified, no TWI registers to be written at boot-time
  are provided to the Front-End Module driver.

include: base.yaml

properties:
  init-regs:
    type: array
    description:
      Array that contains pairs of internal offsets of nRF22xx registers to be written at
      boot-time and the values of these registers.
