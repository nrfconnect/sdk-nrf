  This is a representation of the Skyworks SKY66407-11 Radio Front-End module.
  It is supplementing the generic representation of FEM with settling time and
  gain values appropriate for SKY66407-11 device.

compatible: "skyworks,sky66407-11"

include: generic-fem-two-ctrl-pins.yaml

properties:
  ctx-settle-time-us:
    type: int
    default: 23
    description: |
      Settling time in microseconds from activation of CTX to transmit.

      The default value is based on the experimentally determined settle
      time, that was observed on SKY66112-11 device.

  crx-settle-time-us:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: |
      Settling time in microseconds from activation of CRX to receive.

      The default value is based on the experimentally determined settle
      time, that was observed on SKY66112-11 device.

  tx-gain-db:
    type: int
    default: 12
    description: |
      TX gain of the PA amplifier of SKY66407-11 in dB.

      Default value is based on Table 5 of the SKY66407-11 data sheet
      (February 27, 2023). This is not a fixed parameter of the device.
      Table 7 lists the relationship between CTX voltage/current and
      bias resistance.

  rx-gain-db:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      RX gain of the LNA amplifier of SKY66407-11 in dB.

      Based on the data sheet (February 27, 2023) for SKY66407-11 has no
      receiving gain. This is a fixed parameter of the device. The
      value can be changed if, instead of SKY66407-11, another device
      with different gain, but compatible with the control interface
      via the CTX, CRX pins is used.
