  This is a representation of the nRF2220 Radio Front-End module.

  See the "nordic,nrf2220-fem-twi" binding to configure the TWI (I2C)
  interface. The TWI interface should be configured as a child node
  of the TWI (I2C) bus you have connected to the FEM. Then you "connect"
  the FEM and TWI configurations using the twi-if property.

  Here is an example nRF2220 configuration with a TWI interface
  selected, using the TWIM0 peripheral found on several nRF5 SoCs:

  &i2c0 {
    status = "okay";

    my_twi_if: nrf2220_fem_twi@36 {
      compatible = "nordic,nrf2220-fem-twi";
      status = "okay";
      reg = <0x36>;
    };
  };

  nrf_radio_fem: nrf2220_fem {
    compatible = "nordic,nrf2220-fem";
    cs-gpios = <&gpio1 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
    md-gpios = <&gpio1 11 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
    twi-if = <&my_twi_if>;
    output-power-dbm = <10>;
    bypass-gain-db = <-1>;
    /* ... other nRF2220 properties go here ... */
  };

  &radio {
    fem = <&nrf_radio_fem>;
  };

  In the above example, the nRF2220 is configured for use with:

  - CS on P1.7 (from 'cs-gpios')
  - MD on P1.11 (from 'md-gpios')
  - TWI/I2C communication via TWIM0 (the bus, or parent node, of the 'my_twi_if' node)
  - Output power of 10dBm when using power amplifier
  - Bypass attenuation used for calculations of 1dB

  You must perform any additional required TWI/I2C pin configuration
  (nRF2220 CLK and DATA pins) within the TWIM bus node
  ('i2c0' in the above example). See your TWI/I2C node's binding for
  details on these pin mux properties. You can use any TWI/I2C node
  available in your SoC's devicetree.

properties:
  cs-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description:
      GPIO of the SoC controlling the CS pin of the nRF2220 family member device.

  md-gpios:
    type: phandle-array

  output-power-dbm:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      Output power in dBm at FEM output, when the FEM is in Transmit state
      (power amplifier is used).
