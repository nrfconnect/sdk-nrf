    This controls some of the nRF21540 Radio Front-End module signals
    used on the BL5340PA module. It is used in conjunction with the
    Nordic nRF21540 FEM driver (MPSL) that is part of the Nordic Connect SDK.

    The driver limits the power output based on the antenna type and the
    region.

    In the Laird Connectivity module, the SPI lines do not control the FEM,
    but they must be put into the correct state for low power operation.
    This is due to errata with with the FEM. The Laird Connectivity hardware
    configuration is not completely supported by the Nordic FEM driver.

    The associated driver also controls antenna select based on whether or not
    there is an internal or external antenna. The antenna select signal cannot
    be fixed to one value because of errata with the FEM.

    For these reasons, the SPI interface and antenna select gpio must not be part
    of the nRF radio FEM node.

            If true, use power table for internal antenna variant (SA) and antenna

            If false (not present), use power table for external antenna (SC) and
            antenna select will mimic power down signal.
