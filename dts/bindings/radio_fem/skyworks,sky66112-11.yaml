    This is a representation of the Skyworks SKY66112-11 Radio Front-End module.
    It is supplementing the generic representation of FEM with settling time and
    gain values appropriate for SKY66112-11 device.

            Settling time in microseconds from activation of CTX to transmit.

            The default value has been determined experimentally: it is the
            minimum time interval between asserting the CTX signal and starting
            the radio transmission, which does not generate unacceptable
            interference level on adjacent channels. The tests concerned a
            configuration in which nRF5x SoC controlling the SKY66112-11.
            The value can be adjusted for other tuned configurations.

    crx-settle-time-us:
        type: int
        default: 5

            Settling time in microseconds from activation of CRX to receive.

            The default value has been determined experimentally: it is the
            minimum time interval between asserting the CRX signal and starting
            the radio reception, which does not degrade transmission quality
            indicators (compared to a constantly turned on FEM LNA). The tests
            concerned a configuration in which nRF5x SoC controlling
            the SKY66112-11. The value can be adjusted for other tuned
            configurations.

    tx-gain-db:
        type: int
        default: 22
        description: |
            TX gain of the PA amplifier of SKY66112-11 in dB.

            Default value is based on Table 5 of the SKY66112-11 data sheet
            (July 19, 2019). This is a fixed parameter of the device. The value
            can be changed if, instead of SKY66112-11, another device with
            different gain, but compatible with the control interface via the
            CTX, CRX pins is used.

        type: int
        default: 11
