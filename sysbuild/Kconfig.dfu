	  Enabling this option adds support for Device Firmware Update (DFU) for the nRF70 Series
	  Firmware Patch.

	  This feature requires the addition of an MCUBoot partition pair: a primary and a
	  secondary partition. These partitions are used to store the new firmware patch. The
	  specific partition numbers to be used depend on the number of partitions already in use.

	  The "nrf70_wifi_fw" partition must be added to the newly created MCUBoot primary
	  partition. Once this Kconfig option is enabled, the nRF70.hex file will be signed by
	  MCUBoot. The signed image will then be merged with the application image and flashed onto
	  the target board.

	  Ensure that the required MCUBoot partitions are properly configured before enabling this
	  option. Refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on partition configuration
	  and the DFU process.
