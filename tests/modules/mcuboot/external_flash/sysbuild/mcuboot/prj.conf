# In order to provide board specific configurations to the MCUboot child image
# we also need to provide a base configuration for MCUboot. This file contains
# the basic configurations needed to successfully build and run MCUboot.

# MCUboot requires a large stack size, otherwise an MPU fault will occur
CONFIG_MAIN_STACK_SIZE=10240

# Enable flash operations
CONFIG_FLASH=y

# This must be increased to accommodate the bigger images.
CONFIG_BOOT_MAX_IMG_SECTORS=256

# Enable serial recovery
CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE=n
CONFIG_MCUBOOT_SERIAL=y
CONFIG_MCUBOOT_SERIAL_DIRECT_IMAGE_UPLOAD=y

# Use minimal C library instead of the Picolib
CONFIG_MINIMAL_LIBC=y
