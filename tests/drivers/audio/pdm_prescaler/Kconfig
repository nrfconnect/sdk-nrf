config TEST_PDM_SAMPLING_RATE
	int "PDM sample rate in Hz"
	default 10000
	help
	  The test will use it to define frequency of PDM sampling and
	  calculate the size of the buffer.

config TEST_PDM_EXPECTED_FREQUENCY
	int "Expected PDM_CLK frequency in Hz"
	default 1000000
	help
	  The test will use it to confirm that the captured PDM_CLK
	  frequency in correct.

config TEST_PDM_SAMPLING_TIME
	int "PDM sampling time for one block in ms"
	default 100
	help
	  The test will use it to calculate the size of data block and
	  determine the period of capturing timer.
