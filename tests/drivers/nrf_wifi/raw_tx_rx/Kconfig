config NRF_WIFI_RAW_TX_PKT_SAMPLE_CHANNEL
	int "Channel for non-connected Station mode"
	range 1 233
	help
	  Specify the Wi-Fi channel for transmitting raw TX packets in non-connected Station mode.
	  The valid channel range is 1 to 233.

config NRF_WIFI_RAW_RX_PKT_TIMEOUT_S
	int "Wi-Fi raw RX packet timeout in seconds"
	default 5000

config RAW_TX_PKT_SAMPLE_RATE_VALUE
	int "MCS index or Data rate value"
	default 0
	help
	  Specify the Wi-Fi data rate value for raw TX packet transmission.
	  The value represents either the data rate in Mbps or Modulation and coding (MCS) index.
	  Note: 5.5Mbps is treated specially as 55 to avoid floating point usage.
	  Legacy: 1, 2, 55, 11, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54
	  MCS index: 0-7

config RAW_TX_PKT_SAMPLE_RATE_FLAGS
	int "Rate flag value"
	range 0 4
	default 1
	help
	  Specify the rate flag value to be used for raw TX packet transmission.
	  Rate Flags:
	  0 - Legacy
	  1 - 11n format
	  2 - VHT format
	  3 - HE_SU
	  4 - HE_ER_SU

config RAW_TX_PKT_SAMPLE_QUEUE_NUM
	int "Queue number"
	default 0
	range 0 4
	help
	  Specify the transmission queue number for raw TX packets.
	  0 - Background
	  1 - Best effort
	  2 - Video
	  3 - Voice
	  4 - Beacon.

config RX_THREAD_STACK_SIZE
	int "Thread Stack Size"
	default 4096
	help
	  This option sets the stack size for the threads used in the sample.

config RAW_TX_RX_TRANSMIT_COUNT
	int "Number of raw packets to transmit and receive"
	default 1
	help
	  This option sets the number of packets to be transmitted and received in loopback mode.

config RAW_TX_TRANSMIT_COUNT
	int "Number of raw packets to burst transmit"
	default 3
	help
	  This option sets the number of packets to be transmitted in burst mode.

config RAW_RX_THROUGHPUT_COUNT
	int "Number of times throughput is calculated per second"
	default 1
	help
	  This option sets the count for the number of times throughput is to be calculated.

config RX_THROUGHPUT_INTERVAL
	int "Interval in milliseconds for each throughput calculation"
	default 50
	help
	  This configuration allows the throughput to be calculated for a specified interval.
	  Set the interval to 1000 milliseconds if 1 sec interval throughput readouts are needed.
	  The number of times througphpt is calculated is throughput count * throughput interval.

config RAW_TX_THROUGHPUT_COUNT
	int "Number of times throughput is calculated per throughput interval"
	default 1
	help
	  This option sets the count for the number of times transmit throughput is to be calculated.

config RAW_TX_THROUGHPUT_INTERVAL
	int "Interval in milliseconds for each throughput calculation"
	default 50
	help
	  This configuration allows the throughput to be calculated for a specified interval.
	  Set the interval to 1000 milliseconds if 1 sec interval throughput readouts are needed.
	  The number of times througphpt is calculated is throughput count * throughput interval.

	help
	  This configuraiton allows RX burst logging enable.

config TX_THREAD_TRANSMIT
	bool "enable for thread based transmit"
	help
	  This configuration allows thread based burst transmission.

config RAW_TX_BURST
	bool "enable RAW TX burst"
	help
	  This configuration allows RAW TX burst transmission ZTEST to be enabled.

config RAW_RX_BURST
