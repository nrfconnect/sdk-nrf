	  Maximum allowed offset between sent and received samples.
	  Value is in "full" audio samples.
	  Offset of 1 "full" audio sample is:
	  - 1 byte for mono 8 bit word size.
	  - 2 bytes for stereo 8 bit word size.
	  - 2 bytes for mono 16 bit word size.
	  - 4 bytes for stereo 16 bit word size.
	  - 4 bytes for mono 32 bit word size.
	  - 8 bytes for stereo 32 bit word size.

config I2S_TEST_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Number of bytes send in one transaction"
	default 16
	help
	  Value has to be a multiple of 8 bytes. Test supports up to 32 bytes.

config I2S_TEST_WORD_SIZE_32_BIT_UNSUPPORTED
	bool "32 bit word size is not supported by the driver"
	help
	  When set to 'y' testing 32 bit word size is skipped.

config I2S_TEST_BLOCK_SIZE_8_UNSUPPORTED
	bool "Block_size of 8 bytes is not supported by the driver"
	default y if DT_HAS_NORDIC_NRF_TDM_ENABLED
	help
	  When set to 'y', test that use 8 bytes of data check if
	  i2s_configure() returns -EINVAL.
	  When set to 'n', test will do the I2S transmission.
