config TEST_SLEEP_DURATION_MS
	int "Amount of time (in milliseconds) the core is sleeping"
	default 1000
	help
	  Set sleep duration to TEST_SLEEP_DURATION_MS milliseconds.
	  Based on the value of 'min-residency-us' specified for each power state defined in the DTS,
	  core enters the lowest possible power state.

config DATA_FIELD
	int "Number of bytes exchanged in single SPI transceive operation"
	default 4
	help
	  Set number of bytes exchanged in single spi_transceive() operation.
	  Values from 1 to 16 bytes are confirmed to work correctly.

config TEST_SPI_HOLD_ON_CS
	bool "Enable / Disable test for SPI chip select hold"
	help
	  By default, each spi_transceive_dt() activates SPI CS signal before transmission and
	  deactivates it after the transmission has completed.
	  When this KConfig is enabled, first SPI transmission activates SPI CS signal and
	  it is kept active until spi_release() is executed.

config TEST_SPI_LOCK_ON
	bool "Test with SPI lock enabled/disabled"
	help
	  Keep the device locked after the transaction for the current config.
	  When this KConfig is enabled, SPI device is locked until spi_release() is executed.

config TEST_SPI_RELEASE_BEFORE_SLEEP
	bool "Enable / Disable release of the SPI device"
	depends on TEST_SPI_HOLD_ON_CS || TEST_SPI_LOCK_ON
	default y
	help
	  When this KConfig is enabled, SPI is released before entering low power state.
	  When TEST_SPI_HOLD_ON_CS=y and TEST_SPI_RELEASE_BEFORE_SLEEP=y then
	  each test iteration will see one rising and one falling edge on SPI CS signal.
	  When TEST_SPI_HOLD_ON_CS=y and TEST_SPI_RELEASE_BEFORE_SLEEP=n then
	  first test iteration will see SPI CS signal activation. Next test iterations
	  will NOT observe changes on SPI CS signal.
