		If False, all test vectors in all test_vector_* files are used as a test basis.
		If True, only the test vectors in test_vectors.c are used.

	  Some test vectors are much slower than others.
	  If True these will not be tested.
	  Do a search of CRYPTO_LONG_RUNNING_VECTORS_DISABLE amongst the
	  test_vectors_* files to see which vectors are affected.
