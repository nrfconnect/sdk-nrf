Use this test sample to run secure and non-secure Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) regression tests.

Requirements
************

This test sample requires that the device is provisioned with the PSA root-of-trust security parameters using the :ref:`provisioning image <provisioning_image>` sample.
Build and flash the provisioning image sample before using the test sample.

The tests support the following development kits:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp_ns, nrf9151dk_nrf9151_ns, nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns, nrf9161dk_nrf9161_ns

Overview
********

Run both the secure and non-secure TF-M regression tests using the Zephyr build system.

The build system will replace the Zephyr application with the non-secure TF-M test application, while the secure tests will be included in the TF-M build itself.

The TF-M regression tests are implemented in the tf-m-tests repo: https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-M/tf-m-tests.git/.

Configuration
*************

Tests for both the secure and non-secure area are enabled by default, but can be controlled via the Kconfig options :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_REGRESSION_S` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_REGRESSION_NS` respectively.

Building and running
********************

.. |test path| replace:: :file:`tests/tfm/tfm_regression_test/`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_test.txt

.. note::
    For programming, use the :ref:`programming command without --erase <programming_params_no_erase>`.
    Programming with ``--erase`` or ``--recover`` (or similar parameters) will erase the PSA platform security parameters.

Test files can be found under :file:`/modules/tee/tf-m/tf-m-tests/tests_reg` in the |NCS| folder structure.
