TF-M: Platform security architecture test
#########################################

   :depth: 2

The TF-M platform security architecture test sample provides a basis for validating compliance with PSA Certified requirements using the ArmÂ® Platform Security Architecture (PSA) test suites.

Requirements
************

When the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_ATTESTATION` is enabled, it is required that the device is provisioned with the PSA root-of-trust security parameters using the :ref:`provisioning image <provisioning_image>` sample.
To provision the device, build and flash the provisioning image sample before using the test sample.

The test supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp_ns, nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns

Overview
********

The PSA tests are implemented in the psa-arch-tests repo: https://github.com/ARM-software/psa-arch-tests.
Run PSA test suites tests with Zephyr and TFM.

To choose a test suite, use the ``CONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_*`` Kconfig options.
Only one of these suites can be run at a time.

Configuration
*************

The following Kconfig options can be used to choose a test suite:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_CRYPTO`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_PROTECTED_STORAGE`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_INTERNAL_TRUSTED_STORAGE`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_STORAGE`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_INITIAL_ATTESTATION`

Building and running
********************

.. |test path| replace:: :file:`tests/tfm/tfm_psa_test/`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_test.txt

.. note::
    For programming, use the :ref:`programming command without --erase <programming_params_no_erase>`.
    Programming with ``--erase`` or ``--recover`` (or similar parameters) will erase the PSA platform security parameters.

You can indicate the desired test suite by using a configuration flag when building (replace ``<build_target>`` with your board name, for example ``nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns``):

.. code-block:: console

    west build -b <build_target> nrf/tests/tfm/tfm_psa_test -- -DCONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_STORAGE=y

Note that not all test suites are valid on all boards.
