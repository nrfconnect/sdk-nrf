TF-M: Platform security architecture test
#########################################

   :depth: 2

The TF-M platform security architecture test sample provides a basis for validating compliance with PSA Certified requirements using the ArmÂ® Platform Security Architecture (PSA) test suites.

Requirements
************

The test supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp_ns, nrf9151dk_nrf9151_ns, nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns, nrf9161dk_nrf9161_ns

Overview
********

Run the PSA test suite tests with Zephyr and TF-M.

To choose a test suite, use the ``CONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_*`` Kconfig options.
Only one of these suites can be run at a time.

Configuration
*************

The following Kconfig options can be used to choose a test suite:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_CRYPTO`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_PROTECTED_STORAGE`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_INTERNAL_TRUSTED_STORAGE`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_STORAGE`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_INITIAL_ATTESTATION`

|config|

Building and running
********************

.. |test path| replace:: :file:`tests/tfm/tfm_psa_test/`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_test.txt

.. note::
    For programming, use the :ref:`programming command without --erase <programming_params_no_erase>`.
    Programming with ``--erase`` or ``--recover`` (or similar parameters) will erase the PSA platform security parameters.

You can indicate the desired test suite by using a configuration flag when building (replace ``<board_target>`` with your board name, for example ``nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns``):

.. code-block:: console

    west build -b <board_target> nrf/tests/tfm/tfm_psa_test -- -DCONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_STORAGE=y

When the test suite :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_INITIAL_ATTESTATION` is selected, it is required that the device is provisioned with the PSA root-of-trust security parameters using the :ref:`provisioning image <provisioning_image>` sample.
To provision the device, build and flash the provisioning image sample.
Then run the PSA test suite with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    west build -b <build_target> nrf/tests/tfm/tfm_psa_test -- -DCONFIG_TFM_PSA_TEST_INITIAL_ATTESTATION=y -DCONFIG_TFM_PARTITION_INITIAL_ATTESTATION=y -DCONFIG_TFM_NRF_PROVISIONING=y

Not all test suites are valid on all boards.
See the :file:`testcase.yaml` file for the list of valid test suites for each board.

.. note::
   The following test cases are currently failing:
    - 216: Testing crypto generator functions APIs
    - 601: Testing attestation initial attestation APIs

Test files can be found under :file:`/modules/tee/tf-m/psa-arch-tests` in the |NCS| folder structure.
They are checked out from `nrfconnect/sdk-psa-arch-tests <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-psa-arch-tests>`_, a fork of the `zephyrproject-rtos/psa-arch-tests <https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/psa-arch-tests>`_ repository, which in turn is a fork of the `ARM-software/psa-arch-tests <https://github.com/ARM-software/psa-arch-tests>`_  source repository.
