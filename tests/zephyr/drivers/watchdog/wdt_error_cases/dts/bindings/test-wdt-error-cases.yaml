    This binding provides resources required to build and run the
    tests/drivers/watchdog/wdt_error_cases test in Zephyr.

compatible: "test-wdt-error_cases"

properties:
  opt-pause-in-sleep:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If true, the watchdog timer will be paused when the CPU is in sleep mode.
      This is useful to prevent the watchdog from triggering during low-power
      states.
  opt-pause-halted-by-dbg:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If true, the watchdog timer will be paused when the CPU is halted by a
      debugger. This allows the watchdog to be used during debugging without
      triggering a reset.
  test-wdt-max-window:
    type: int
    description: |
      The maximum window size for the watchdog timer.
