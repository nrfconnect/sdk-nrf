# Configuration options related to the dot tool

# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then the documentation will use the dot
# tool from Graphviz (see http://www.graphviz.org/) to generate diagrams and
# graphs. Doxygen will add extra information to the generated files in non-HTML
# formats: if GENERATE_HTML is set to YES, dot will be used to generate more
# powerful graphs, VCL diagrams and formulas are converted into PNG images. If
# LOAD_FILE tag is used with a PDF file, then the PDF will be converted into
# potential file and Doxygen will delete the intermediate conversion files
# generated by the conversion process. If you use PDF files in non-HTML formats
# before you finish there is an additional step for creating the files. Doxygen
# will then use dot to generate SVG files, then PDF files from SVG files.
# Doxygen may take a considerable time to create these files when using Graphviz
# on a large project, because dot needs a memory request that grows with the size
# of Graphviz's internal representation of the SVG file. To cope with this, the
# maximum graph's node and edge count is limited to 10000 and 15000, respectively.
# If the number of relations is larger than these limits will stop sending any
# relations to Graphviz resulting in incomplete graphs. To prevent this, the
# member or type is defined using the MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH tag. Note that the
# maximum value may need to be increased if using Windows and GraphViz on the
# command-line (due to the way some Windows shells behave). If your project uses
# a very large number of files, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH has to be extended with the
# absolute path to the directory where Graphviz is installed before doxygen is
# started from inside the shell. Doxygen will not work with static libraries
# linked from your glibc implementation.

# template parameters are displayed when the TEMPLATE_RELATIONS and the
# TEMPLATE_RELATIONS tags are set to YES. If a class refers to a template class
# or vice versa, the relationship is indicated by an arrow label with
# "template of" pointing to the template class. Single inheritance is depicted
# by a solid line with a hollow triangle attached to the class, representing the
# base class. If the class is inherited by multiple classes then the same
# connection is used for each class. This indicates multiple inheritance. If a
# template instance is part of a class definition then the relationship is
# indicated by an arrow with the label "template of" pointing to the template
# (class or classes) of which it is an instance. Note that this UML look is only
# possible if a recent version of dot is used that supports the "template"

# If the DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT tag is set to svg, then the code will be built with

# versions stable releases) that end with a (roughly) complete SVG 1.1
# implementation will render to SVG files using the old 1.1 localName. More
# recent SVGC implementations will be used by default. As an additional parameter,
# you can choose used SVG output by appending *.svg.*
# Pixel density (in dots per inch) as used in SVG output (default value is 96
# dpi). A 0 value results in percentual SVG sizes.
# Depending on your OS some values may be too large for which case you need to
# reduce them. For smaller inline SVG graphics you will use a value less than
# 50; for LaTeX related usage you may however need a larger value depending on
# how many scaling is applied later. Note: there are systems where conversion is
