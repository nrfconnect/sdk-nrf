Libraries / Subsystems
**********************

* Management

  * MCUMGR functionality deprecated in 3.1 has been removed:
    CONFIG_FS_MGMT_UL_CHUNK_SIZE, CONFIG_IMG_MGMT_UL_CHUNK_SIZE,
    CONFIG_OS_MGMT_ECHO_LENGTH
  * MCUMGR fs_mgmt issue with erasing a file prior to writing the first block
    of data has been worked around by only truncating/deleting the file data
    if the file exists. This can help work around an issue whereby logging is
    enabled and the command is sent on the same UART as the logging system, in
    which a filesystem error was emitted.
