Major changes
*************

The following list contains the most important changes since the last release:

* Added a secure boot sample for PCA10090, which provides a reference implementation of a first-stage boot firmware. The sample configures resources for the secure domain and boots an application from the non-secure domain. See :ref:`secure_boot`.
* Added **at_host** library. This library helps creating an AT command socket and forwards requests and responses from and to the modem.
* Added **at_client** sample. This sample uses the **at_host** library to provide a UART interface for AT commands.
* Added a porting library for the BSD socket library that is located in the nrfxlib repository.
* Added a library that uses the MQTT protocol over BSD sockets. This library will be replaced by the upstream Zephyr library in the future.
* Added **nrf_cloud** library. This library implements features to connect and send data to nRF Cloud services.
* Added **nrf_cloud** sample for PCA10090. This sample uses the **nrf_cloud** library.
* Added **gps_sim** library. This library simulates a simple GPS device providing NMEA strings with generated data that can be accessed through the GPS API.
* Added **sensor_sim** library. This library simulates a sensor device that can be accessed through the sensor API, currently supporting the acceleration channels in the API.
* Added :doc:`MCUboot <mcuboot:index>` documentation.
* Added documentation for the :ref:`peripheral_uart` sample and the :ref:`nus_service`.
* Added **scan** library for BLE. This library handles BLE scanning for your application. See :ref:`nrf_bt_scan`.
* Added **gatt_db_discovery** library for BLE. This library handles service discovery on BLE GATT servers. See :ref:`gatt_db_discovery`.
* Added **central_hids** BLE sample. This sample connects to HID devices and uses **gatt_db_discovery** library to perform HID service discovery.
* Added **ndef** libraries for NFC. These libraries handle NDEF records and message generation. Text and URI records are supported for now.
* Added **record_text** NFC sample. This sample uses the NFC Type 2 Tag to expose a Text record to NFC polling devices. It requires the binary libraries in the nrfxlib repository.
* Added **writable_ndef_msg** NFC sample. This sample uses the NFC Type 4 Tag to expose an NDEF message, which can be overwritten by NFC polling devices. It requires the binary libraries in the nrfxlib repository.
