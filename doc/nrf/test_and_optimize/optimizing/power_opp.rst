In addition to the :ref:`general power optimization recommendations <app_power_opt_general>`, you can use the `Online Power Profiler (OPP)`_ browser application when optimizing the power consumption of your application.

Online Power Profiler calculates the current consumption when using different protocols:

* `Online Power Profiler for Bluetooth LE`_ for the :ref:`Bluetooth LE protocol <ug_bt>` (for selected nRF52, nRF53, and nRF54L Series SoCs)
* `Online Power Profiler for Matter over Thread`_ for :ref:`Matter over Thread <ug_matter_overview_architecture_integration_designs_thread>` (for selected nRF52, nRF53, and nRF54L Series SoCs)
* `Online Power Profiler for Wi-Fi`_ for :ref:`ug_wifi` (for the nRF70 Series SoCs)
* `Online Power Profiler for LTE`_ for :ref:`ug_lte` (for the nRF9160 DK); see also :ref:`app_power_opt_nRF91`
