`Matter`_ (formerly Project Connected Home over IP or Project CHIP) is an open-source application layer that aims at creating a unified communication standard across smart home devices, mobile applications, and cloud services.
It supports a wide range of existing technologies, including Wi-Fi, Thread, and BluetoothÂ® LE, and uses IPv6-based transport protocols like TCP and UDP to ensure connectivity between different kinds of networks.

Matter is in an early development stage and must be treated as an experimental feature.

The |NCS| allows you to develop applications that are compatible with Matter.
See :ref:`matter_samples` for the list of available samples or :ref:`Matter Weather Station <matter_weather_station_app>` for specific Matter application.
If you are new to Matter, check also the tutorials on `DevZone`_.
