About this documentation
########################

The documentation consists of several inter-linked documentation sets, one for each repository.
You can switch between these documentation sets by using the selector in the bottom-left corner of each page.

The entry point is the |NCS| documentation that you are currently reading.
The local :doc:`Zephyr documentation <zephyr:index>` is a slightly extended version of the official `Zephyr Project documentation`_, containing some Nordic Semiconductor specific additions.
The local :doc:`MCUboot documentation <mcuboot:index>` is a slightly extended version of the official `MCUboot`_ documentation, containing some Nordic Semiconductor specific additions.

The |NCS| documentation contains all information that is specific to the |NCS| and describes our libraries, samples, and applications.
API documentation is extracted from the source code and included with the library documentation.
