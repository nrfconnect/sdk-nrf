Amazon Sidewalk samples
#######################

The |NCS| provides several samples showcasing the :ref:`Amazon Sidewalk <ug_sidewalk>` protocol.
You can build the samples for different board targets and configure them depending on the usage scenarios.

To see a full list of supported Amazon Sidewalk samples, refer to Samples section on the `Amazon Sidewalk documentation`_ page.
After the |NCS| release v2.9.1, the Amazon Sidewalk protocol is no longer a part of the |NCS|.
It is now moved to the add-on structure and released separately.
