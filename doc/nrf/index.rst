Welcome to the |NCS|!
#####################

The |NCS| is where you begin building low-power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, and nRF91 Series devices.

The SDK contains optimized cellular IoT (LTE-M and NB-IoT), Bluetooth® Low Energy, Thread, Zigbee, and Bluetooth mesh stacks, a range of applications, samples, and reference implementations, as well as a full suite of drivers for Nordic Semiconductor's devices.
The |NCS| includes the Zephyr™ real-time operating system (RTOS), which is built for connected low power products.

To access different versions of the |NCS| documentation, use the version drop-down in the top right corner.
A "99" at the end of the version number of this documentation indicates continuous updates on the main branch since the previous major.minor release.

In addition to the |NCS| documentation, information is available in the following locations:
