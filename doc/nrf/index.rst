Welcome to the |NCS|!
#####################

The |NCS| is where you begin building low power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, and nRF91 Series devices.

The SDK contains optimized cellular IoT (LTE-M and NB-IoT), Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, Zigbee, and Bluetooth Mesh stacks, a range of applications, samples, and reference implementations, as well as a full suite of drivers for Nordic Semiconductor's devices.
The |NCS| includes the Zephyrâ„¢ real-time operating system (RTOS), which is built for connected low power products.

.. note::
   nRF53 Series devices (which are pre-production) and Thread, Zigbee, and Bluetooth Mesh protocols are supported for development in |release| for prototyping and evaluation.
   Support for production and deployment in end products is coming soon.
