Welcome to the |NCS|!
#####################

The |NCS| is where you begin building low power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, and nRF91 Series devices.

The SDK contains optimized cellular IoT (LTE-M and NB-IoT), Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, Zigbee, and Bluetooth mesh stacks, a range of applications, samples, and reference implementations, as well as a full suite of drivers for Nordic Semiconductor's devices.
The |NCS| includes the Zephyr™ real-time operating system (RTOS), which is built for connected low power products.

.. note::

   nRF53 Series devices are now supported for production.
   Wireless protocol stacks and libraries may indicate support for development or support for production for different series of devices based on verification and certification status.


.. previous note about development and production support
..   nRF53 Series devices (which are pre-production) and Zigbee and Bluetooth mesh protocols are supported for development in |release| for prototyping and evaluation.
..   Support for production and deployment in end products is coming soon.
