Welcome to the |NCS|!
#####################

The |NCS| is where you begin building low power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, and nRF91 Series devices.

The SDK contains optimized cellular IoT (LTE-M and NB-IoT), Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, Zigbee, and Bluetooth mesh stacks, a range of applications, samples, and reference implementations, as well as a full suite of drivers for Nordic Semiconductor's devices.
The |NCS| includes the Zephyr™ real-time operating system (RTOS), which is built for connected low power products.

.. note::

   nRF53 Series devices are supported for production.
   Wireless protocol stacks and libraries may indicate support for development or support for production for different series of devices based on verification and certification status.

To access different versions of the |NCS| documentation, use the version drop-down in the top left corner.
To view the documentation from the different repositories that are part of |NCS|, click the arrow in the bottom left corner and select the desired document set.
A "99" at the end of the version number of this documentation indicates continuous updates on the master branch since the previous major.minor release.

The search functionality only works for the documentation set you are in.
For example, if you search in the |NCS| documentation set, you will only find documents related to it, not Zephyr documentation.
