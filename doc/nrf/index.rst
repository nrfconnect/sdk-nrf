   |NCS| v1.9.99-dev1 is a development tag and will be replaced by v2.0.0 in the future.

   The development tag contains the following major updates, marked as experimental:

   * The current development state for LwM2M version 1.1 and AVSystem integration for nRF Cloud Location Services through LwM2M.

   * A Bluetooth LE Audio standard example through the new :ref:`octave` application and LE Audio Controller Subsystem for nRF53.

   For other changes that are included in this development tag, see :ref:`ncs_release_notes_changelog`.

The |NCS| is where you begin building low-power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, and nRF91 Series devices.

The SDK contains optimized cellular IoT (LTE-M and NB-IoT), Bluetooth® Low Energy, Thread, Zigbee, and Bluetooth mesh stacks, a range of applications, samples, and reference implementations, as well as a full suite of drivers for Nordic Semiconductor's devices.
The |NCS| includes the Zephyr™ real-time operating system (RTOS), which is built for connected low power products.
