Introduction
############

The |NCS| is Nordic Semiconductor's software development kit for building low-power wireless applications based on the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, nRF54, nRF70, and nRF91 Series wireless devices.

How to get started with the |NCS|
  * To get started with a device you have without needing to install the |NCS|, see the :ref:`gsg_guides` section.
    The Quick Start app allows you to test your device using a guided process with precompiled binaries.
  * To install the |NCS|, see the :ref:`install_ncs` page in the :ref:`installation` section.
    You can use |VSC| or command line as the development environment.
  * If you wan to go through a dedicated training to familiarize yourself with the basic functionalities of the |NCS|, enroll in the `nRF Connect SDK Fundamentals course`_ in the `Nordic Developer Academy`_.

How to work with the |NCS|
  * To create an application using the |NCS|, see the :ref:`ug_app_dev` section.
    The section includes information on topics such as creating an application, supported boards, and bootloaders and DFU.
    It also provides additional information for specific Nordic Semiconductor devices, and topics such as working with front-end modules.
  * To see how to implement typical use cases using the |NCS|, see the :ref:`application` and :ref:`samples` sections.
    Samples showcase a single feature or library, while applications include a variety of libraries to implement a specific use case.
  * To refine an application you have developed or one provided by the |NCS|, see the :ref:`test_and_optimize` section.
    It covers topics such as debugging, logging, and optimization for both memory and power.
  * If you want to go through a dedicated training to familiarize yourself with topics and techniques related to developing applications in the |NCS|, enroll in the `nRF Connect SDK Intermediate course`_ in the `Nordic Developer Academy`_.

How to learn more about the |NCS|
  * To learn about the security features in the |NCS|, see the :ref:`security` section.
    The |NCS| offers features such as access port protection, Trusted Firmware-M, and trusted storage.
  * If you want know more about the protocols supported by the |NCS|, see the :ref:`protocols` section.
    The |NCS| supports Bluetooth®, cellular, Matter, Thread, Wi-Fi®, and other protocols.
  * To learn about the more technical parts of the |NCS|, see the :ref:`drivers`, :ref:`libraries` and :ref:`scripts` sections.
    The documentation for the drivers and libraries also includes the respective API documentation.
  * To learn about different versions and software maturity levels of the |NCS|, see the :ref:`releases_and_maturity` section.
    The section includes release notes, migration guides, and known issues.
  * To learn about the |NCS| itself, see the :ref:`about_sdk` section.
    It covers topics such as development model and contributions, as well as the |NCS| documentation itself.
  * If you want to go through dedicated training to familiarize yourself with developing for some of the protocols available in the |NCS|, enroll in the `Bluetooth LE Fundamentals course`_, `Cellular IoT Fundamentals course`_, or `Wi-Fi Fundamentals course`_ in the `Nordic Developer Academy`_.
