Welcome to the |NCS|!
#####################

The |NCS| is where you begin building low power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, and nRF91 Series devices.

The SDK contains optimized cellular IoT (LTE-M and NB-IoT), Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, Zigbee, and Bluetooth Mesh stacks, a range of applications, samples, and reference implementations, as well as a full suite of drivers for Nordic Semiconductor's devices.
The |NCS| includes the Zephyrâ„¢ real-time operating system (RTOS), which is built for connected low power products.

.. note::
   nRF53 Series devices (which are pre-production) and Thread, Zigbee, and Bluetooth Mesh protocols are supported for development in v1.3.0 for prototyping and evaluation.
   Support for production and deployment in end products is coming soon.

Documentation for different versions of the |NCS| is available at the following links:

* `nRF Connect SDK latest documentation`_ (from the master branch)
