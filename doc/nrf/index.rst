The |NCS| is where you begin building low power cellular IoT applications with LTE-M and NB-IoT on the nRF9160.
It offers a range of application samples and reference implementations, as well as a full suite of device drivers for the nRF9160 SiP.
The |NCS| includes the Zephyrâ„¢ real-time operating system (RTOS), which is built for connected low power products.

.. note::
   The |NCS| contains references and code for Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the nRF52 Series, though product development on these devices is not currently supported with the |NCS|.

Documentation for different versions of the |NCS| is available at the following links:

* `nRF Connect SDK latest documentation`_ (updated weekly)
