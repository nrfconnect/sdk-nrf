Welcome to the |NCS|!
#####################

The |NCS| is where you begin building low power cellular IoT applications with LTE-M and NB-IoT on the nRF9160, and Bluetooth Low Energy applications on the nRF5340.
It offers a range of application samples and reference implementations, as well as a full suite of drivers for Nordic Semiconductor's devices.
The |NCS| includes the Zephyrâ„¢ real-time operating system (RTOS), which is built for connected low power products.

.. note::
   The |NCS| contains reference applications, sample source code, and libraries for developing low-power wireless applications with nRF52 and nRF53 Series devices, though support for these devices is incomplete and not recommended for production.

Documentation for different versions of the |NCS| is available at the following links:

* `nRF Connect SDK latest documentation`_ (from the master branch)
* `nRF Connect SDK v1.1.0 documentation`_
* `nRF Connect SDK v1.0.0 documentation`_
* `nRF Connect SDK v0.4.0 documentation`_
* `nRF Connect SDK v0.3.0 documentation`_
