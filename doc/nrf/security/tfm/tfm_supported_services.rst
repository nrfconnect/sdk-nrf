This page lists the supported features and limitations of Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) in the |NCS|.

.. _ug_tfm_supported_services_profiles:

Supported TF-M profiles
***********************

The `Trusted Firmware-M <TF-M documentation_>`_ provides several :ref:`tf-m_profiles` for different use cases and levels of TF-M configuration.

The |NCS| *does not* follow this classification.
Instead, it provides two main configurations for TF-M: minimal and configurable.

.. list-table:: Supported TF-M configurations in the |NCS|
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: auto

   * - Configuration profile
     - Support status in the |NCS|
     - Description
   * - Minimal
     - :ref:`Supported <software_maturity>`
     - Bare-minimal configuration to allow the device to boot securely. Contains only random number generator and :ref:`allows for a limited number of operations <ug_tfm_supported_services_profiles_minimal>`.
   * - Configurable (full)
     - :ref:`Experimental <software_maturity>`
     - Full configuration that allows you to enable or disable different partitions in the TF-M configuration file. See :ref:`tfm_configurable_build` for more information.
   * - :ref:`TF-M Small <tf-m_profiles>`
     - Not supported
     - Basic lightweight TF-M framework with basic Secure Services to keep smallest memory footprint.
   * - :ref:`TF-M ARoT-less <tf-m_profiles>`
     - Not supported
     - Reference implementation to align with security requirements defined in PSA Certified ARoT-less Level 2 protection profile.
   * - :ref:`TF-M Medium <tf-m_profiles>`
     - Not supported
     - Profile Medium aims to securely connect devices to Cloud services with asymmetric cipher support.
   * - :ref:`TF-M Large <tf-m_profiles>`
     - Not supported
     - Profile Large protects less resource-constrained Arm Cortex-M devices.

Hardware support matrix for TF-M configurations
  Expand the following field to list the software maturity levels for the TF-M configurations in the |NCS| for each device.

.. _ug_tfm_supported_services_profiles_minimal:

Minimal TF-M configuration
==========================

.. minimal_build_overview_start

The default configuration of TF-M has all supported features enabled, which results in a significant memory footprint.
For this reason, the |NCS| provides a minimal version of the TF-M secure application, which shows how to configure a reduced version of TF-M.

The secure services supported by the minimal version allow for:

* Generating random numbers using the random generator available in the device (see `crypto.h`_).
* Using the :ref:`platform services <ug_tfm_services_platform>` with `tfm_platform_api.h`_ from the non-secure side (except the ``tfm_platform_nv_counter_*`` functions).
  This includes sending platform-specific service requests using `tfm_ioctl_core_api.h`_ and `tfm_ioctl_api.h`_.
* Reading secure memory from the non-secure application (strictly restricted to a list of allowed addresses).
  Depending on the device, this lets you read metadata in the bootloader, verify FICR or UICR values, or access a peripheral that is secure-only.
* Rebooting from the non-secure side.

.. minimal_build_overview_end

See :ref:`ug_tfm_building` for more information on building the TF-M secure application with the minimal build.

.. _ug_tfm_supported_services_profiles_configurable:

Configurable TF-M build
=======================

.. configurable_build_overview_start

The configurable build is the full TF-M implementation that lets you configure all of its features.
It does not have the constraints of the minimal build.

.. configurable_build_overview_end

When you use the configurable build, you can enable or disable any of the features in the application configuration file.
See :ref:`tfm_configurable_build` for more information on building the TF-M secure application with the configurable build.

.. _ug_tfm_supported_services_isolation:

Isolation Level support

Limitations
***********

The following sections summarize the limitations of TF-M in the |NCS|, organized by category.

Core features
=============

* TF-M profiles are not supported.
* Isolation level 3 is not supported.
* TF-M's second-stage bootloader (BL2) is not supported.
  Instead, the |NCS| uses its own version of MCUboot (`sdk-mcuboot`_), which is supported with TF-M and provides.
  See :ref:`ug_bootloader_mcuboot_nsib` for more information.
* For Isolation level 2, the number of peripherals that are configurable as secure in the Application Root of Trust (ARoT) is limited by available MPU regions.

Security services
=================

* Firmware Update service is not supported.
* Firmware verification is not supported.
* Firmware encryption is not supported.
* Protected off-chip data storage and retrieval are not supported.
* Audit logging is not supported.

Cryptography
============

The following crypto modules and ciphers are not supported:

* AES output feedback (AES-OFB) mode.
* AES cipher feedback (AES-CFB) mode.

Development and integration
===========================

* GCC is the only supported toolchain for building TF-M on Nordic Semiconductor devices.
* :zephyr:code-sample-category:`tfm_integration` samples from upstream Zephyr are not compatible with the :ref:`ug_tfm_supported_services_tfm_services` implemented in the |NCS| when built from upstream Zephyr.
