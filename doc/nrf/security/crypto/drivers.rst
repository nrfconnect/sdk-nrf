The cryptographic drivers provide hardware-accelerated and software-based implementations of cryptographic operations for the |NCS| applications.
The drivers are compatible with the :ref:`Oberon PSA Crypto <ug_crypto_architecture_implementation_standards_oberon>` implementation of the `PSA Certified Crypto API`_ standard.

Driver architecture within Oberon PSA Crypto
********************************************

In the |NCS|, you manage and select the cryptographic drivers using the :ref:`nrf_security` library.
nRF Security provides a unified interface for the :ref:`Oberon PSA Crypto <ug_crypto_architecture_implementation_standards_oberon>` implementation.
It implements the driver wrapper role and determines which driver to use for each cryptographic operation.

In addition to the driver wrapper, the Oberon PSA Crypto implementation also includes the Oberon PSA Core module.
This central component implements the PSA Certified Crypto API and exposes it to applications.
The core module performs parameter validation, handles key management, and forwards calls to the driver wrapper.

The nrf_cc3xx and nrf_oberon drivers are provided as closed-source libraries.
The CRACEN driver is open-source.

.. note::
   Do not use the drivers directly.
   Use them only through the :ref:`supported PSA Crypto API implementations <ug_crypto_architecture_implementation_standards>` and nRF Security.
   For configuration steps, see :ref:`psa_crypto_support`.

The following figure shows the Oberon PSA Crypto implementation with the cryptographic drivers:

.. psa_crypto_driver_table_start

The cryptographic drivers are organized into hardware and software drivers.
Hardware drivers take precedence over software drivers, which provide fallback options in case the hardware drivers are not available for a wanted cryptographic operation for a given hardware platform.

Driver selection
****************

The following figure shows a simplified overview of the driver library selection using the driver wrapper:

.. figure:: ../images/psa_certified_api_lib_selection.svg
   :alt: Oberon PSA Crypto driver library selection
   :align: center

   Oberon PSA Crypto driver library selection

As shown in this simplified figure, the API calls can go in both directions between the driver wrapper and the drivers.
This represents the following situations:

* `Feature selection`_ - Based on hardware capabilities and cryptographic features you have configured, the driver wrapper selects the most appropriate driver for each cryptographic operation.
* `Software fallback`_ - The Oberon PSA Crypto implementation in the |NCS| provides a transparent fallback mechanism that allows applications to use the software nrf_oberon driver when the hardware acceleration is not available.
* `Driver chaining`_ - Higher-level drivers (like HMAC) can delegate operations to lower-level drivers (like hash functions).
  For example, when an HMAC operation is requested, the HMAC driver might call back to the driver wrapper to use a hardware-accelerated hash function.

These situations are explained in more detail in the following sections.

.. _crypto_drivers_example_flow:

Example of driver selection flow
================================

The following figure demonstrates the driver selection process in more detail:

.. figure:: ../images/psa_certified_api_lib_selection_details.svg
   :alt: Detailed process for Oberon PSA Crypto driver library selection
   :align: center

   Detailed process for Oberon PSA Crypto driver library selection

The figure specifically mentions the CC310 hardware peripheral next to the nrf_cc3xx driver and three random features:

* Feature A - Supported by the nrf_cc3xx driver through the CC310 hardware peripheral and the nrf_oberon driver, but not supported by the CRACEN driver.
  Feature A is enabled in both hardware and software drivers.
* Feature B - Supported only by the nrf_oberon driver.
* Feature C - Supported by the CRACEN driver and the nrf_oberon driver, but not supported by the nrf_cc3xx driver.
  Feature C is disabled for the CRACEN driver in the application configuration.

For the purpose of this example, it is assumed that the application and the target platform are compatible with both the nrf_cc3xx and the CRACEN drivers.
This is different from the real-world scenarios, where the CRACEN driver is only available on the nRF54L Series devices.

When an application initiates a cryptographic operation through the PSA Crypto API, the following steps take place:

1. The Oberon PSA Crypto implementation receives the request and validates the parameters in the Oberon PSA Core module.
#. The Oberon PSA Core module forwards the request to the driver wrapper.
#. The driver wrapper determines which driver to use based on the following criteria:

   * The specific cryptographic operation requested
   * Available hardware capabilities on the platform
   * Configuration priorities

#. The driver wrapper selects the appropriate driver and forwards the request to the driver.
   Using the example of the three features:

   * Feature A - The driver wrapper follows the default configuration process and selects the nrf_cc3xx driver (assuming that the platform supports it.)
     The software nrf_oberon driver could also be chosen, but the nrf_cc3xx driver is given priority because it is hardware-accelerated.
   * Feature B - The driver wrapper selects the software nrf_oberon driver.
     This is because neither the nrf_cc3xx driver nor the CRACEN driver support Feature B.
   * Feature C - The driver wrapper selects the software nrf_oberon driver, following the configuration priority set by the application.
     The CRACEN driver supports this feature, but the user has disabled the hardware driver support for Feature C in the application configuration.

.. _crypto_drivers_feature_selection:

Feature selection
=================

The Oberon PSA Crypto implementation provides a mechanism for configuring each cryptographic operation.
This mechanism uses the ``PSA_WANT_*`` directives for specifying the cryptographic features and ``PSA_USE_*`` directives for selecting the driver for each cryptographic operation.
The driver wrapper then selects the most appropriate driver for each cryptographic operation.

Feature selection in the |NCS|
------------------------------

In Zephyr and the |NCS|, Oberon's ``PSA_WANT_*`` and ``PSA_USE_*`` directives are integrated into the :ref:`Kconfig configuration system <app_build_system>`.
As a result, Oberon's directives are wrapped by Kconfig options ``CONFIG_PSA_WANT_*`` and ``CONFIG_PSA_USE_*``, respectively.
Some of these Kconfig options are defined in Zephyr, while others are defined in the |NCS| in the :ref:`nrf_security` subsystem.
You only need to set the Kconfig options, not the directives.

The following table provides a brief overview of the available directives and their corresponding Kconfig options that you can set:

.. list-table:: Driver configuration directives

   * - Oberon directive pattern
     - Description
     - Kconfig option pattern
     - Examples of Oberon directives
     - Examples of corresponding Kconfig options
   * - ``PSA_WANT_*``
     - Specify the cryptographic features needed by the application (algorithms, key types, and key sizes).
     - `CONFIG_PSA_WANT_*`_
     - | ``PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_AES``
       | ``PSA_WANT_ALG_SHA_256``
     - | :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_AES`
       | :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_WANT_ALG_SHA_256`
   * - ``PSA_USE_*``
     - Select the driver you prefer to use for the cryptographic operation (when available).
     - `CONFIG_PSA_USE_*`_
     - | ``PSA_USE_CC310_KEY_MANAGEMENT_DRIVER``
       | ``PSA_USE_CC310_HASH_DRIVER``
     - | :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_USE_CC3XX_KEY_MANAGEMENT_DRIVER`
       | :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_USE_CC3XX_HASH_DRIVER`

.. note::
   For the complete overview of the available configuration options, see the :ref:`ug_crypto_supported_features` page.

When you select Kconfig options for the wanted features and drivers, nRF Security checks the Oberon directives to make the optimal driver selection.
To combine the settings in Kconfig that represent application requirements (``PSA_WANT_*``) and driver preferences from the user (``PSA_USE_*``), nRF Security uses ``PSA_NEED_*`` macros.
These macros are automatically selected.
They control which drivers are compiled into the build and thus available for use at runtime for `Software fallback`_ and `Driver chaining`_.

The following figure shows an overview of this process:

.. figure:: ../images/psa_want_use_need_flow.svg
   :alt: Detailed process for feature and driver selection
   :align: center

.. _crypto_drivers_software_fallback:

Software fallback
=================

The Oberon PSA Crypto implementation in the |NCS| provides a transparent fallback mechanism that allows applications to use the software nrf_oberon driver when the hardware acceleration is not available.
If a hardware driver does not support a particular operation or key size, the driver wrapper will redirect the call to a software implementation.

The software fallback can happen at runtime and works as follows:

* No software fallback required - If hardware acceleration is enabled and available for the requested features, nRF Security selects the preferred driver for performance and security reasons.
* Software fallback required - If no hardware driver is enabled and available, or if the hardware or the preferred driver do not support the specific cryptographic operation, nRF Security falls back to the software nrf_oberon driver.

The software fallback mechanism to the nrf_oberon driver is enabled by default in the |NCS|.
You can :ref:`manually disable the software fallback mechanism <psa_crypto_support_disable_software_fallback>`.
For example, you can do that if you want the cryptographic operations to run in hardware only.

Examples of feature selection and software fallback
===================================================

Click the following expand button to see examples of how nRF Security selects the drivers based on the Kconfig options.

.. toggle::

   * You can configure the application to use CC310 and require the AES-192 key size through the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_WANT_AES_KEY_SIZE_192` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_USE_CC3XX_KEY_MANAGEMENT_DRIVER` Kconfig options.
     nRF Security selects the nrf_cc3xx driver if it supports the CCM-AES-192 acceleration with the AES-192 key size.
     The CC310 peripheral does not support AES keys larger than 128 bits, so nRF Security selects the nrf_oberon driver instead, thus automatically setting the ``PSA_NEED_OBERON_KEY_MANAGEMENT_DRIVER`` macro.
     (This is the case of the :ref:`Feature A in the example flow <crypto_drivers_example_flow>`.)
   * You can configure the application to require the SHA-512 hashing functionality through the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_WANT_ALG_SHA_512` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_USE_CC3XX_HASH_DRIVER` Kconfig options.
     nRF Security selects the nrf_cc3xx driver if it is available for the hardware platform and if it supports the SHA-512 hashing functionality.
     The CryptoCell-enabled hardware acceleration does not support the SHA-512 hashing functionality, so nRF Security falls back to the nrf_oberon software implementation, thus automatically setting the ``PSA_NEED_OBERON_HASH_DRIVER`` macro.
     (This is the case of the :ref:`Feature B in the example flow <crypto_drivers_example_flow>`.)
   * You can configure the application to require the SHA-256 hashing functionality through the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_WANT_ALG_SHA_256` Kconfig option, but set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_USE_CRACEN_HASH_DRIVER` Kconfig option to ``n`` so that the CRACEN driver is not used.
     In this case, the conditions for automatically setting the ``PSA_NEED_CRACEN_HASH_DRIVER`` macro are not met.
     nRF Security selects the nrf_oberon software implementation, thus automatically setting the ``PSA_NEED_OBERON_HASH_DRIVER`` macro.
     (This is the case of the :ref:`Feature C in the example flow <crypto_drivers_example_flow>`.)

Driver chaining
===============

Driver chaining is a feature that allows using multiple cryptographic drivers to delegate functionality between them.
This mechanism enables optimal use of hardware acceleration by combining software and hardware cryptographic drivers.
This allows for complex cryptographic operations that may be only partially supported in hardware.

In driver chaining, a driver that implements more complex algorithms (like HMAC) can delegate less complex algorithms (like SHA-256) to another driver.
This delegation happens between the drivers through the driver wrapper, transparently to the application, and at runtime.
The delegation process follows the same priority rules as the driver selection, preferring hardware implementations when available.

Driver chaining optimizes the mix of software and hardware implementations to achieve the best performance.
At the same time, it ensures all cryptographic operations are supported across different platforms.

Driver chaining in the |NCS|
----------------------------

Driver chaining is handled in the |NCS| at runtime when you :ref:`enable multiple drivers at the same time <psa_crypto_support_multiple_drivers>` and then enable specific :ref:`nrf_oberon driver features in combination with driver features for hardware acceleration <nrf_security_drivers_config_features>`.

Common driver chains supported in the nrf_oberon driver include the following cases:

* PAKE â Key Derivation
* Signature â Hash
* Deterministic signature â MAC
* RSA â Hash
* DRBG â AES, MAC, Entropy
* Key Derivation â MAC
* MAC â Hash, AES

The set of drivers available for chaining is determined by the ``PSA_NEED_*`` macros automatically set by nRF Security, as described in :ref:`crypto_drivers_feature_selection`.
Only drivers whose ``PSA_NEED_*`` macros are enabled by nRF Security at compile time can participate in driver chaining.

For example, by enabling the nrf_cc3xx driver and the nrf_oberon driver, you can chain the MAC driver and the hash driver.
The drivers handle this requirement as follows:

1. The MAC driver feature calls back to the PSA crypto driver wrapper APIs to execute the hash calculation.
   This allows nrf_oberon to access hardware-accelerated hash algorithms as long as they are supported and enabled.
#. If a specific hash algorithm is not supported, the enabled hardware-accelerated driver returns ``PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED``.
#. The nrf_oberon driver handles the request to calculate hash algorithms unsupported in hardware.
