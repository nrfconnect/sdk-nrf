Bluetooth mesh
##############

The |NCS| provides support for developing applications using the Bluetooth mesh protocol.
The support is based on Zephyr's :ref:`bluetooth_mesh` implementation.

See :ref:`samples` for the list of available Bluetooth mesh samples.

The Bluetooth mesh samples use the `nRF Mesh mobile app`_ to perform provisioning and configuration.
