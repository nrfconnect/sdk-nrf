Template: Library
#################

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 2

.. note::
   Use this template to create pages that describe the libraries included in the |NCS|, following these instructions:

   * Use this first section to give a short description (1 or 2 sentences) of the library, indicating what it does and why it should be used.

   * Give the library a concise name that also corresponds to the folder name.

     If the library targets a specific protocol or device, add it in the title before the library name (for example, "NFC:" or "nRF9160:").
     Do not include the word "library" in the title.
     Use the provided stock phrases and includes when possible.

   * If possible, start the reference tag at the top of the page with ``_lib_``.

   * Sections with ``*`` are optional and can be left out.
     All the other sections are required for all libraries.

     Do not add new sections or remove a mandatory section without consulting a tech writer.
     If any new section is needed, try first to fit it as a subsection of one of the sections listed below.

     When you keep an optional section, remove the asterisk from the title, and format the length of the related RST heading accordingly.

   * Include a tech writer in the PR review.
