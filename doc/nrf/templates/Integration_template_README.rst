.. note::
   Provide a short introductory description of the product or service, indicating the value it brings to |NCS|.
   Refer to the following instructions to create the description:

   * Provide a title that starts with the product or service name with "integration" as a suffix, for example, "Memfault integration".
   * Place the documentation inside the :file:`nrf/doc/nrf/external_comp` folder.
   * List the file name with path in the ``.. toctree:`` of the :file:`integrations` RST file.
   * Sections with * are optional and can be left out.
     All other sections are required.
     There could be more sections, which can be added after discussion with the tech writer team.
     However, it should have the mandatory sections from the template in the recommended format at the very least.

.. tip::
   Describe the product or service briefly (full sentences, not sentence fragments), so that the user gets a clear idea of what the product or service does.
   This introduction must be concise and clear, highlighting the features of the product or service that it brings to |NCS|.

Edge Impulse is a development platform that can be used to enable embedded machine learning on |NCS| devices.
You can use this platform to collect data from sensors, train machine learning model, and then deploy it to your Nordic Semiconductor device.

Product overview*
*****************

.. note::
   Provide an explanation of the product.
   This is optional if the product is described above.

XYZ integration provides the following features to |NCS|:

Solution architecture
*********************

.. note::
   * Provide a short description of how the various components of the integration interact with each other.
   * Mention the :term:`Development Kit (DK)` used for integration, how it interacts with the product or service, and what the key elements are, for example connectivity and onboarding.
   * Include a diagram showing the interaction, if possible.

Integration overview*
*********************

.. note::
   Explain in more detail how the integration of |NCS| with the product or service works.
   This is optional if the integration details are covered in the integration steps.

Integration steps
*****************

.. note::
   * Explain the integration in steps.
     For an example, see the :ref:`ug_integrating_fast_pair` section of the :ref:`ug_bt_fast_pair` documentation.

.. tip::
   * You can list the configuration that must be enabled for the integration to work (if applicable).
   * You can add information about overlay configuration files and how they are specified in the build system using |VSC| or command line to enable specific features (if applicable).

Some title*
***********

.. note::
   Add optional sections for other technical details about the integration (for example, user-defined configuration options).
   Give suitable titles (sentence style capitalization, thus only the first word capitalized).
   If there is nothing important to point out, you need not include any such section.
