Installing the |NCS|
####################

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 2

There are different ways to install the |NCS|, depending on your preferred development environment:

* Using |VSC| and :ref:`requirements_nrfvsc` (recommended)
* Using command line and :ref:`requirements_nrf_util`

Regardless of which way you choose, the following steps install the |NCS| source code and the |NCS| :term:`toolchain`.
This includes everything that is required by Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:getting_started` together with additional tools and Python dependencies that the |NCS| uses.

.. note::
    Using |VSC| and |nRFVSC| is also covered in the `Installing nRF Connect SDK and VS Code`_ exercise of the `nRF Connect SDK Fundamentals course`_ on Nordic Developer Academy.

.. rst-class:: numbered-step

Update operating system
***********************

Before you start setting up the toolchain, install available updates for your :ref:`operating system <supported_OS>` to make sure it supports the |NCS| firmware.

.. include:: ./recommended_versions.rst
    :start-after: os_table_start
    :end-before: os_table_end

.. rst-class:: numbered-step

Install prerequisites
*********************

.. prerequisites-include-start

Depending on your preferred development environment, install the following software tools.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF Connect for VS Code

      .. include:: /includes/install_sdk_common_prerequisites.txt

      Additionally, install |VSC|:

      * The latest version of |VSC| for your operating system from the `Visual Studio Code download page`_ or `using this direct link <start VS Code walkthrough_>`_.
      * In |VSC|, the latest version of the `nRF Connect for VS Code Extension Pack`_.
        |nRFVSC| comes with its own bundled version of some of the nRF Util commands.

      .. note::
         You can also use a different IDE compatible with the VSIX format and install the extensions that are part of the nRF Connect for VS Code Extension Pack from the `Open VSX Registry`_.
         However, Nordic Semiconductor does not test editors other than |VSC| for compatibility with |nRFVSC|.
         While you are encouraged to report any issues you encounter on `DevZone`_, issues discovered in editors other than |VSC| and not reproducible in |VSC| will not be prioritized.

   .. group-tab:: Command line

      .. include:: /includes/install_sdk_common_prerequisites.txt

      Additionally, just for the development in command line, you need a separate nRF Util download to install the |NCS| toolchain:

      * `Download the executable <nRF Util Downloads_>`_ for the latest version of nRF Util.

        .. note::
           After downloading the nRF Util executable, move it to a directory that is in the system :envvar:`PATH`.
           On macOS and Linux, the downloaded file also needs to be given execute permission by typing `chmod +x nrfutil` or by checking the checkbox in the file properties.

Install the |NCS| code and toolchain
************************************

Every |NCS| release consists of a combination of :ref:`ncs_git_intro` repositories at different versions and revisions, managed together by :ref:`ncs_west_intro`.
The revision of each of those repositories is determined by the current revision of the main (or :ref:`manifest <zephyr:west-manifests>`) repository, `sdk-nrf`_.
Simply put, you can work with the following versions of the |NCS|:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - |NCS| version
     - Required identifier of the revision
     - Where to find the identifier
   * - Specific release (recommended)
     - Release tag (for example, |release_tt|)
     - :ref:`Release_notes` of the release
   * - :ref:`Git tag <dm_revisions_git_tags>`
     - Development tag (for example, ``v2.8.0-rc1``)
     - :ref:`Changelog <release_notes>` of the tag
   * - Branch
     - Branch name (for example, ``main``)
     - `sdk-nrf`_ repository

For each version of the |NCS|, Nordic Semiconductor provides a dedicated toolchain.
The |NCS| :term:`toolchain` includes the Zephyr SDK and then adds tools and modules required to build |NCS| samples and applications on top of it.
These include the :ref:`required SDK tools <requirements_toolchain_tools>`, the :ref:`Python dependencies <requirements_toolchain_python_deps>`, and the :ref:`GN tool <ug_matter_gs_tools_gn>` for creating :ref:`ug_matter` applications.
You can check the versions of the required tools and Python dependencies on the :ref:`Requirements reference page <requirements_toolchain>`.

.. note::
   Unless you are familiar with the :ref:`development process <dev-model>`, you should always work with a specific, stable release of the |NCS|.

For more information about the repository and development model, see the :ref:`dm_code_base` page.

When you install |NCS| for the first time, you have neither the SDK code nor the toolchain installed.
Depending on your preferred development environment, complete the following steps:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF Connect for VS Code

      .. note::
         If you prefer, you can now `start VS Code walkthrough`_ and install the toolchain and the SDK from there.

      1. Open the nRF Connect extension in |VSC| by clicking its icon in the :guilabel:`Activity Bar`.
         The extension loads and the `Welcome View`_ appears with two buttons: :guilabel:`Install SDK` and :guilabel:`Install Toolchain`.
      #. Click on :guilabel:`Install SDK`.
      #. Select the region for download.

         You only need to select the region for downloads once.
         The selected region applies to all future SDK and toolchain downloads.
         You can later change it in the |VSC| settings.

         The list of available SDK types appears.

      #. Select :guilabel:`nRF Connect SDK`.
         The list of available stable versions for the |NCS| appears in the |VSC|'s quick pick, grouped into two categories:

         * :guilabel:`Pre-packaged SDKs & Toolchains` - Available on the Nordic Semiconductor server.
           The package downloads both the SDK and toolchain, but skips the toolchain if you have it already installed.
           Available mostly for stable releases and some Git tags.
           Recommended for faster and more reliable download and installation.
         * :guilabel:`GitHub` - Taken from the `nRF Connect by Nordic Semiconductor GitHub organization <nrfconnect GitHub organization_>`_.
           Available for stable releases, but also Git tags and branches.

      #. Select an |NCS| version to install from the :guilabel:`Pre-packaged SDKs & Toolchains` category.
         |install_latest_version|

      The SDK and toolchain installation starts and it can take several minutes.
      You can follow the progress in the notification that appears.

      After the installation is complete, the extension's :guilabel:`Welcome View` is updated to feature :guilabel:`Manage toolchains` and :guilabel:`Manage SDKs` menus.
      You can use these menus to install other versions of the |NCS| and toolchain, either together or separately.
      See the `extension documentation <How to set up SDK and toolchain_>`_ for more information.

   .. group-tab:: Command line

      1. Open a terminal window.
      #. Remove the lock on the nRF Util installation to be able to install other nRF Util commands.
         See `Locking nRF Util home directory`_ in the tool documentation for more information.
      #. Run the following command to install the nRF Util's ``sdk-manager`` command:

         .. code-block:: console

            nrfutil install sdk-manager

      #. Run the following command to list the available installations:

         .. code-block:: console

            nrfutil sdk-manager search

         The versions from this list correspond to the |NCS| versions and will be *version* in the following step.
      #. Run the following command to install the SDK and the toolchain for the SDK version of your choice:

         .. parsed-literal::
            :class: highlight

            nrfutil sdk-manager install *version*

         For example:

         .. parsed-literal::
            :class: highlight

            nrfutil sdk-manager install |release|

         This example command installs both the SDK code and the toolchain for the |NCS| |release|.
         |install_latest_version|

         .. note::
            If you plan to work with a specific branch, use the command for installing the latest |NCS| release (|release|) to install the latest toolchain.
            Then, you must use the ``west init`` command several steps below to get the code of the desired branch.
            This is because the ``sdk-manager`` command only supports installing specific release versions.

         The ``sdk-manager`` command installs the SDK by default at :file:`C:/ncs/` on Windows and at :file:`~/ncs/` on Linux, and the toolchain in the :file:`toolchains` subdirectory.
         The SDK installation location can be modified, as explained in the `command documentation <sdk-manager Configuration settings_>`_.
         On macOS, :file:`/opt/nordic/ncs/` and :file:`/opt/nordic/ncs/toolchains` are used and no other locations are allowed.
         The :file:`ncs` directory holds all |NCS| repositories.

         If you have received a custom URL or a toolchain bundle ID for installing the toolchain, you can use dedicated commands to provide it.
         Expand the section below to see the commands.

         .. toggle::

            If you have received a custom URL for installing the toolchain, you can use the following commands to set it as default, replacing the respective parameters:

            .. parsed-literal::
               :class: highlight

               nrfutil sdk-manager config toolchain-index add *index-name* *custom_toolchain_URL*
               nrfutil sdk-manager config toolchain-index set *index-name*

            If you have received a custom bundle ID for installing a specific toolchain version, you can use the following commands to provide it, replacing the respective parameter:

            .. parsed-literal::
               :class: highlight

               nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain install --toolchain-bundle-id *custom_bundle_ID*

            To learn more about ``sdk-manager`` commands, use the ``nrfutil sdk-manager --help`` command, or see the `command documentation <sdk-manager command_>`_.

      #. Start the toolchain environment for your operating system using the following command pattern, with ``--ncs-version`` corresponding to the |NCS| version you have installed:

         .. tabs::

            .. tab:: Windows

               .. parsed-literal::
                  :class: highlight

                  nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain launch --ncs-version *version* --terminal

               For example:

               .. parsed-literal::
                  :class: highlight

                  nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain launch --ncs-version |release| --terminal

               This example command starts the toolchain environment for the |NCS| |release|.

            .. tab:: Linux

               .. parsed-literal::
                  :class: highlight

                  nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain launch --ncs-version *version* --shell

               For example:

               .. parsed-literal::
                  :class: highlight

                  nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain launch --ncs-version |release| --shell

               This example command starts the toolchain environment for the |NCS| |release|.

            .. tab:: macOS

               .. parsed-literal::
                  :class: highlight

                  nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain launch --ncs-version *version* --shell

               For example:

               .. parsed-literal::
                  :class: highlight

                  nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain launch --ncs-version |release| --shell

               This example command starts the toolchain environment for the |NCS| |release|.

         ..

         .. note::

            You can also use other options instead of ``--ncs-version``.
            See the `sdk-manager command documentation <sdk-manager Starting and inspecting the toolchain environment_>`_ for more information.

      #. Determine the identifier of the revision of the |NCS| you want to work with.
         See the table above for more information.
         |install_latest_version|

      #. Initialize west with the revision of the |NCS| that you want to check out, replacing the required parameters:

         .. parsed-literal::
            :class: highlight

            west init -m https\://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf --mr *nRFConnectSDK_revision* *nRFConnectSDK_revision_workspace_dir*

         In this command:

         - The first *nRFConnectSDK_revision* identifies the revision of the |NCS|.
         - The second *nRFConnectSDK_revision_workspace_dir* is the name of the workspace directory that will be created by west.
           For this installation method, it should be the same as the *nRFConnectSDK_revision*.

         The command creates the *nRFConnectSDK_revision* subdirectory and checks out the given revision of the |NCS| inside it.
         For example:

         * **Specific release:** To check out the |release| release, enter the following command:

           .. parsed-literal::
              :class: highlight

              west init -m https\://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf --mr |release| |release|

         * **Git tag:** To check out the ``v2.8.0-rc1`` tag, enter the following command:

           .. code-block:: console

              west init -m https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf --mr v2.8.0-rc1 v2.8.0-rc1

         * **Branch**: To check out the ``main`` branch that includes the latest state of development, enter the following command:

           .. code-block:: console

              west init -m https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf --mr main main

         This will clone the manifest repository `sdk-nrf`_ into :file:`nrf`.

         Initializing west with a specific revision of the :ref:`manifest file <zephyr:west-manifest-files>` does not lock your repositories to this version.
         Checking out a different branch or tag in the `sdk-nrf`_ repository and running ``west update`` changes the version of the |NCS| that you work with.

         .. west-error-start

         .. note::

            If you get an error message when running west, :ref:`update west <west_update>` to the latest version.
            See :ref:`zephyr:west-troubleshooting` in the Zephyr documentation for more information.

         .. west-error-end

      #. Enter the *nRFConnectSDK_revision* subdirectory and run the following command to clone the project repositories:

         .. code-block:: console

            west update

         Depending on your connection, this might take some time.
      #. Export a :ref:`Zephyr CMake package <zephyr:cmake_pkg>`.
         This allows CMake to automatically load the boilerplate code required for building |NCS| applications:

         .. code-block:: console

            west zephyr-export

With the default locations to install the SDK code (:file:`C:/ncs` on Windows, :file:`~/ncs/` on Linux, and :file:`/opt/nordic/ncs/` on macOS) and its toolchain (:file:`C:/ncs/toolchains` on Windows, :file:`~/ncs/toolchains/` on Linux, and the non-modifiable :file:`/opt/nordic/ncs/toolchains/` on macOS), your directory structure now looks similar to this:

.. code-block:: none

   ncs
   ├─── toolchains
   │  └─── <toolchain-installation>
   └─── <west-workspace>
      ├─── .west
      ├─── bootloader
      ├─── modules
      ├─── nrf
      ├─── nrfxlib
      ├─── zephyr
      └─── ...

In this simplified structure preview, *<toolchain-installation>* corresponds to the toolchain version (most commonly, a SHA) and *<west-workspace>* corresponds to the SDK version name.
There are also additional directories, and the structure might change over time, for example if you later :ref:`change the state of development to a different revision <updating_repos>`.
The full set of repositories and directories is defined in the :ref:`manifest file <zephyr:west-manifest-files>` (`see the file in the repository <west manifest file_>`_).

Set up the command-line build environment
*****************************************

.. note::

   This step is only required when working on command line with freestanding applications.

In addition to the steps mentioned above, if you want to build and program your application from the command line, you have to set up your command-line build environment by defining the required environment variables every time you open a new command-line or terminal window.
See :ref:`zephyr:env_vars_important` in the Zephyr documentation for more information about the various relevant environment variables.

Define the required environment variables as follows, depending on your operating system:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Windows

      Complete the following steps:

      1. Navigate to the :file:`ncs` directory.
      #. Open the directory for your |NCS| version.
      #. Run the following command in a terminal window:

         .. code-block:: console

            zephyr\zephyr-env.cmd

      If you need to define additional environment variables, create the file :file:`%userprofile%/zephyrrc.cmd` and add the variables there.
      This file is loaded automatically when you run the above command.
      See :ref:`Zephyr documentation about using zephyrrc files <zephyr:env_vars_zephyrrc>` for more information.

   .. tab:: Linux

      Complete the following steps:

      1. Navigate to the :file:`ncs` directory.
      #. Open the directory for your |NCS| version.
      #. Run the following command in a terminal window:

         .. code-block:: console

            source zephyr/zephyr-env.sh

      If you need to define additional environment variables, create the file :file:`~/.zephyrrc` and add the variables there.
      This file is loaded automatically when you run the above command.
      See :ref:`Zephyr documentation about using zephyrrc files <zephyr:env_vars_zephyrrc>` for more information.

   .. tab:: macOS

      Complete the following steps:

      1. Navigate to the :file:`ncs` directory.
      #. Open the directory for your |NCS| version.
      #. Run the following command in a terminal window:

         .. code-block:: console

            source zephyr/zephyr-env.sh

      If you need to define additional environment variables, create the file :file:`~/.zephyrrc` and add the variables there.
      This file is loaded automatically when you run the above command.
      See :ref:`Zephyr documentation about using zephyrrc files <zephyr:env_vars_zephyrrc>` for more information.

Alternative method: System-wide installation
********************************************

System-wide installation is an alternative to the recommended installation methods using |nRFVSC| or nRF Util.
It gives you more control over each of the required tools, but requires more familiarity with Zephyr and with each of the tools.

To install the |NCS| system-wide, complete the following steps:

1. Follow the steps in the following sections of Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:getting_started` to update your operating system and install dependencies:

   * :ref:`zephyr:host_setup`
   * :ref:`zephyr:install-required-tools`

#. Install west.
   Expand the section below to see the commands.

   .. toggle::

      .. note::

         It is easy to run into Python package incompatibilities when installing dependencies at a system or user level.
         This situation can happen, for example, if working on multiple Zephyr versions or other projects using Python on the same machine.

         For this reason, it is suggested to use `Python virtual environments`_.

                     Once activated your shell will be prefixed with ``(.venv)``.
                     The virtual environment can be deactivated at any time by running ``deactivate``.

                     .. note::

                     Once activated, your shell will be prefixed with ``(.venv)``.
                     The virtual environment can be deactivated at any time by running ``deactivate``.

                     .. note::

                        Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you start working.

                  #. Install west:

                     .. code-block:: bash

                        pip3 install west

               .. group-tab:: Install globally

                  #. Install west:

                     .. code-block:: bash

                        pip3 install -U west

            ..

      ..

   ..

#. Enter the :file:`ncs` directory you created when setting up the virtual environment:

   .. tabs::

      .. group-tab:: Windows

         .. code-block:: console

            cd %HOMEPATH%/ncs

      .. group-tab:: Linux

         .. code-block:: console

            cd ~/ncs

      .. group-tab:: macOS

         .. code-block:: console

            cd ~/ncs

#. Get the |NCS| code.
   When you first install the |NCS|, it is recommended to install the latest released version of the SDK.
   Run the following command, where *nRFConnectSDK_revision* is the revision of the |NCS| you want to get the code of:

   .. code-block:: console

      west init -m https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf --mr *nRFConnectSDK_revision*

   The command initializes a west workspace in the :file:`ncs` directory and checks out the given revision of the |NCS| `sdk-nrf`_ in the :file:`nrf` subdirectory.
   For example:

   * **Specific release:** To check out the |release| release, enter the following command:

      .. parsed-literal::
         :class: highlight

         west init -m https\://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf --mr |release|

   * **Git tag:** To check out the ``v2.8.0-rc1`` tag, enter the following command:

      .. code-block:: console

         west init -m https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf --mr v2.8.0-rc1

   * **Branch**: To check out the ``main`` branch that includes the latest state of development, enter the following command:

      .. code-block:: console

         west init -m https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf --mr main

     Alternatively, you can omit the ``--mr`` parameter, in which case west uses ``main`` as the default *nRFConnectSDK_revision*.

#. In the :file:`ncs` directory, run the following command to clone the project repositories:

   .. code-block:: console

      west update

#. Install the Python dependencies.

#. Follow the steps in the "Install the Zephyr SDK" section in Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:getting_started` to install the Zephyr SDK.
#. Depending on your preferred development environment:

   * If you want to work with |VSC|, install |nRFVSC| (the default IDE for the |NCS|).
   * If you want to work from command line, :ref:`build_environment_cli`.

#. If you want to build `Matter`_ applications, additionally install the `GN`_ meta-build system.
   This system generates the Ninja files that the |NCS| uses for Matter.
   See :ref:`manual_installation_gn` for more information.
