Matter tools
############

Use tools listed on this page to test :ref:`matter_samples` and develop Matter applications in the |NCS|.

GN tool
*******

To build and develop Matter applications, you need the `GN`_ meta-build system.
This system generates the Ninja files that the |NCS| uses.

If you are updating from the |NCS| version earlier than v1.5.0, see the :ref:`GN installation instructions <gs_installing_gn>`.
