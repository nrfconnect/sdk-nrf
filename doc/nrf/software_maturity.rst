The |NCS| supports its various features and components at different levels of software maturity.
The tables at the end of this page summarize the maturity level for each feature and component supported in the |NCS|.
The following categories are used in the tables to classify the software maturity of each feature and component:

Supported
   The feature or component is implemented and maintained, and is suitable for product development.

Not supported
   The feature or component is neither implemented nor maintained, and it does not work.

Experimental
   The feature can be used for development, but it is not recommended for production.
   This means that the feature is incomplete in functionality or verification and can be expected to change in future releases.
   The feature is made available in its current state, but the design and interfaces can change between release tags.
   The feature is also labeled as ``EXPERIMENTAL`` in Kconfig files to indicate this status.

   .. note::
      By default, the build system generates build warnings to indicate when features labeled ``EXPERIMENTAL`` are included in builds.
      You can disable these warnings by disabling the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_WARN_EXPERIMENTAL` kconfig option.
      See :ref:`app_build_additions` for details.

   * - **Maturity**
     - Suitable for integration in end products.

       A feature or component that is either fully complete on first commit, or has previously been labelled *experimental* and is now ready for use in end products.

     - Suitable for prototyping or evaluation.
       Not recommended to be deployed in end products.

       A feature or component that is either not fully verified according to the existing test plans or currently being developed, meaning that it is incomplete or that it may change in the future.
