`nRF Connect for Desktop`_, a cross-platform tool available for Windows, Linux, and macOS, provides different apps that simplify installing the |NCS|.

.. note::
   When installing the |NCS| through the |GSA| app, you will not be able to build on the command line using west.

On Windows or macOS, use the :ref:`gs_app_tcm`.
