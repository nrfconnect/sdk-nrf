Zigbee
######

Zigbee is a portable, low-power software networking protocol that provides connectivity over a mesh network based on the IEEE 802.15.4 radio protocol.
It also defines an application layer that provides interoperability among all Zigbee devices.

Zigbee add-ons for the |NCS| provide support for developing Zigbee applications based on the third-party precompiled ZBOSS R22 and R23 stacks.
These stacks are included as the ZBOSS Zigbee stack library in Zigbee add-ons repositories.
In combination with the |NCS|, Zigbee add-ons allow for development of low-power connected solutions.

For documentation, see the `Zigbee R22`_ and `Zigbee R23`_ add-ons.
