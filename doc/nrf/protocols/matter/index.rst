`Matter`_ (formerly Project Connected Home over IP or Project CHIP) is an open-source application layer that aims at creating a unified communication standard across smart home devices, mobile applications, and cloud services.
It supports a wide range of existing technologies, including Wi-Fi, Thread, and BluetoothÂ® LE, and uses IPv6-based transport protocols like TCP and UDP to ensure connectivity between different kinds of networks.

.. note::
   The Matter SDK version is taken as the base for the `dedicated Matter fork`_, which can then include additional changes for each |NCS| release.
   These changes are listed in the Matter fork section of the |NCS| :ref:`release_notes`.

For more information about Matter compatibility, see :ref:`ug_matter_overview_dev_model_support` and :ref:`supported Matter features per SoC <software_maturity_protocol_matter>`.

See :ref:`matter_samples` for the list of available samples, :ref:`Matter Weather Station <matter_weather_station_app>` or :ref:`Matter bridge <matter_bridge_app>` for specific Matter application.
If you are new to Matter, you can follow along with the video tutorials on Nordic Semiconductor's YouTube channel, for example `Developing Matter 1.0 products with nRF Connect SDK`_.
