This section provides information about Matter end product development.
It is intended for users who are familiar enough with both the Matter technology and the |NCS|.

The pages that follow deal with the preparation of the device for market launch, starting with :ref:`ug_matter_device_prerequisites` and the reference to the :ref:`ug_matter_device_factory_provisioning` guide.
Finally, we discuss topics related to Matter certification (:ref:`ug_matter_device_attestation`, :ref:`ug_matter_device_dcl`, and :ref:`ug_matter_device_certification`) and :ref:`ug_matter_device_bootloader`.
