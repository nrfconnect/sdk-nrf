Enabling Matter in Kconfig
##########################

To use the Matter protocol, set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP` Kconfig option.
This option enables the Matter protocol stack and other associated features and components, such as C++ support or Zephyr networking layer.

For instructions about how to set Kconfig options, see :ref:`configure_application`.
For a list of advanced Matter Kconfig options, see :ref:`ug_matter_device_advanced_kconfigs`.

Kconfig option structure
************************

The Kconfig options for Matter applications in the |NCS| are stored in the following files:

* :file:`prj.conf` files, which are specific to the application.
* :file:`Kconfig.defaults` file, which is available in the :file:`module/lib/matter/config/nrfconnect/chip-module` directory and is used to populate :file:`prj.conf` with Kconfig option settings common to all samples.

The Matter samples use the same structure for other software images, such as MCUboot, Multiprotocol RPMsg or HCI RPMsg, which have default options defined in the corresponding :file:`Kconfig.mcuboot.defaults`, :file:`Kconfig.multiprotocol_rpmsg.defaults` and :file:`Kconfig.hci_rpmsg.defaults` files.

For an example configuration, see the :ref:`Matter Template sample's <matter_template_sample>` :file:`prj.conf` files in the sample root directory.

Configuration options for other modules
***************************************

Because Matter is an application layer protocol on top of the other IPv6-based transport protocols (see :ref:`ug_matter_architecture`), it uses multiple software modules with their own configuration options to provide the communication between the devices and the necessary functionalities.
It uses modules such as BluetoothÂ® LE, the IPv6 stack (for example :ref:`Thread <ug_thread_configuring>`), :ref:`nRF Security <nrf_security_config>`, or :ref:`MCUboot <mcuboot:mcuboot_ncs>`.
Make sure to review the configuration options of these modules when configuring Matter.
