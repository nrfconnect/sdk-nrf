Testing with commercial Matter ecosystems

Nordic Semiconductor's Matter platform and Matter applications integrated in the |NCS| follow the most recent versions of the Matter protocol and are interoperable with several commercial Matter ecosystems.

Matter allows multiple ecosystems to work with each other thanks to the :ref:`multiple fabrics feature <ug_matter_overview_multi_fabrics>`.
It also lets you use different wireless protocols for different use cases at the same time (for example, Thread or Wi-Fi).

You can test the interoperability of the Matter solution in the |NCS| with a selection of compatible Matter ecosystems by following the `Testing the nRF Connect platform with Apple, Google and Samsung ecosystems`_ tutorial on DevZone.

Prerequisites
*************

At the very least, you need the following pieces of hardware to set up and test the interoperability scenario from the tutorial:

* Matter over Thread development kit: 1x nRF52840 DK or 1x nRF5340 DK
* Matter over Wi-Fi development kit: 1x nRF7002 DK
* Devices from at least one of commercial ecosystems compatible with the official Matter implementation, for example:

  * `Apple Home <Apple Home integration with Matter_>`_
  * `Google Home <Google Home integration with Matter_>`_
  * `Samsung SmartThings <Samsung SmartThings integration with Matter_>`_
  * `Amazon Alexa <Amazon Alexa integration with Matter_>`_

* 1x Wi-Fi Access Point supporting IPv6 connected to the Internet (for example, Asus RT-AC1300G, as used in the tutorial)
* 1x PC with nRF Connect SDK v2.2.0 (or later) installed

Setup and testing
*****************

Follow the steps in the `Testing the nRF Connect platform with Apple, Google and Samsung ecosystems`_ tutorial for detailed setup and testing instructions.
This will allow you to set up and test the following scenario with Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings.
