The Data Model layer describes the supported remote operations of a Matter node using the concepts of attributes, commands and events, grouped into logical blocks called clusters.
The clusters included in the `Matter Application Cluster Specification <CSA Specifications Download Request_>`_ have well-defined scope and behavior to assure interoperability between Matter nodes developed by different vendors.
A cluster can be abstract, meaning that it can underlie several device types to reduce the time and cost of introducing new product categories to Matter.

Nodes
   Each device is composed of one or more nodes, which are complete implementations of a Matter application functionality on a single stack.
   Nodes are identifiable with a unique network address on a single network.
   They can communicate directly with other nodes in the network.

Endpoints
   Each node is composed of one or more endpoints, which contain feature sets of single device functionalities.
   For example, in a voice-controlled door lock device, one endpoint could include the feature set for operating the bolt, while the other endpoint could include the feature set for handling a temperature sensor.

   .. note::
      Endpoint 0 is always reserved for Matter's Utility Clusters.
      This is the only mandatory endpoint for each Matter device.

Clusters
   Endpoints are composed of one or more clusters, which group attributes, commands and events that together make up each single feature in a set.
   For example, in an endpoint for operating a door bolt, one cluster could group attributes for moving the bolt to open or closed position, while other could group attributes for controlling alarms in case the door is opened in unauthorized way.

   Clusters can be of the following types:

   * Server -- responsible for holding values for Attributes, Commands, and Events.
   * Client -- responsible for performing interactions with other Server Clusters.

   The supported Matter application clusters are described in the Application Cluster Specification, available from the `CSA Specifications Download Request`_ page.
   Sets of clusters on one or more endpoint can form a :ref:`device type <ug_matter_device_types>`, that is an officially defined collection of requirements that is conformant with the Device Library Specification.

Attributes
   Attributes are data entities that represent a physical quantity or state.
   They are stored in the Matter device's memory, but can also be calculated dynamically on demand.

Commands
   Commands are actions that can be used to trigger some behavior on other devices.
   For example, in a door lock device the lock door command can be used to trigger such action on a physical device.

Events
   Events are a type of attributes that communicate device state changes.
   They can also be treated as historical data records of something that happened on the device in the past.

Data Model example: Door Lock
*****************************

The following figure illustrates the Data Model structure of a common door lock device.

   Data Model Door Lock example

Each Matter node must ensure that its Endpoint 0 satisfies the requirements of the Root Node device type.
This device type enforces the availability of clusters used in the process of :ref:`Matter commissioning <ug_matter_overview_commissioning>` and further administering of a Matter node.

Besides the Root Node endpoint, the door lock device provides Endpoint 1, which implements the Door Lock Device Type functionality as defined in the Matter Device Library Specification.
This device type enforces the availability of the ``Identify`` and ``DoorLock`` clusters.

Identify cluster
================

The ``Identify`` cluster is a cluster shared across many device types.
It provides commands that allow a user to trigger a special effect, such as blinking an LED, that helps find the physical location of the device.

DoorLock cluster
================

The ``DoorLock`` cluster is a large cluster that contains many attributes, commands, and events for managing and operating a smart lock.

Examples of the attributes are the following:

 * ``LockType`` - A constant that assigns the device to one of the known lock categories.
 * ``LockState`` - An attribute that renders the current state of the lock: locked, unlocked, or moving from one position to another.

Examples of the commands are the following:

 * ``LockDoor`` and ``UnlockDoor`` - For remotely operating the lock.
 * ``SetCredential`` - For configuring the lock to require a specified credential, such as PIN code, to unlock the door.

An example of the event is ``DoorLockAlarm``, which records occurrences of critical states of the lock.
Examples of the critical states are jamming the lock or exceeding the limit of wrong PIN code entries.

Matter device types
*******************

A Matter device type is an officially defined collection of requirements for one or more endpoints.
Device types are intended to ensure interoperability of different device brands on the market.

All device types are defined in the Device Library Specification, which is available from the `CSA Specifications Download Request`_ page.
Each device type definition is composed of the following elements:

* Device type ID
* Device type revision
* One or more mandatory clusters, including each cluster's minimum revision

The device type definition in the Device Library specification can change over time.
The changes are tracked using the Device Type Revision value, which is initially set to ``1``.
Changes do not modify how the device works, but only improve its functionality.

A device type can require other device types for its composition, making it a *composed device type*.

Device type overview
********************

The following tables list the *application device types* that are supported in Matter.

* The description for each device type is taken from the Device Library Specification.
* The state of the device specifies whether a device type can be subject to certification.
  The `Provisional` state indicates that the device type implementation is not yet fully tested and certified, even though the implementation may be ready and you can use it on your own risk.
* The dedicated sample column provides the link to the sample in the |NCS| that implements the given device type, if available.

You can add support for device types without a dedicated sample in the |NCS| by using the :ref:`matter_template_sample` and following the :ref:`ug_matter_creating_accessory` user guide, which describes how to edit clusters of a Matter application.
