.. caution::
   The Amazon Sidewalk protocol is owned and licensed by Amazon.
   Before continuing with the |NCS| for Sidewalk, you must familiarize yourself with the official `Amazon license`_, including all the applicable restrictions.
   Note that redistributing Sidewalk under the |NCS| is prohibited.

   Be aware, that by downloading and including the Sidewalk repository, you accept the above-mentioned license.

   Due to these restrictions, Sidewalk cannot be automatically fetched through the |NCS| and will require a dedicated setup.
   For details, see `Setting up the SDK for Amazon Sidewalk`_.

.. note::
   Amazon Sidewalk is available only in the United States of America.
   To an extent, any Sidewalk gateway functionality might be used outside of the U.S., however, it should be used only for the Amazon Sidewalk endpoint development purposes.
   In addition, we recommend that you consult with your local regulatory bodies, and check if the gateway is allowed to operate its radio in your locale, as U.S. license-free band devices, only for development.

To learn more about the Amazon Sidewalk solution and to see step-by-step setup instructions, refer to the `Amazon Sidewalk documentation`_ page.
After the |NCS| release v2.9.1, the Amazon Sidewalk protocol is no longer a part of the |NCS|.
It is now moved to the add-on structure and released separately.
