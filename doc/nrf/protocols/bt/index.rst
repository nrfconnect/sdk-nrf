The following section contains descriptions of Bluetooth® LE Controller and Bluetooth Mesh, including the guidelines on how to qualify a product that uses these subsystems.

To enable Bluetooth LE in your application, you can use the standard HCI-based architecture, where the Bluetooth Host libraries (:ref:`zephyr:bluetooth`) are included in your application or run Bluetooth API functions as remote procedure calls using :ref:`ble_rpc`.
