###################

The |NCS| provides support for developing applications using the Zigbee protocol.
The protocol uses the :ref:`nrfxlib:zboss` library, a third-party precompiled Zigbee stack available in nrfxlib.

For information about how to start working with Zigbee in |NCS|, see the following pages:

See :ref:`zigbee_samples` for the list of available Zigbee samples.

When working with Zigbee in |NCS|, you can use the following tools during Zigbee application development:

* `nRF Sniffer for 802.15.4 based on nRF52840 with Wireshark`_ - Tool for analyzing network traffic during development.

Using Zigbee tools is optional.
