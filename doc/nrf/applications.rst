Applications
############

The |NCS| provides a set of example applications that show how to implement typical user scenarios using Nordic Semiconductor devices.
Applications typically include a fully integrated software stack and can serve as a starting point for developing your product.
They use interface drivers and libraries from the |NCS| and its set of repositories to implement a specific use case, while :ref:`samples` showcase a single feature or library.

Some applications target custom hardware designed for a specific use case.
You can also run them on different hardware like a generic development kit, but with limited functionality.

If you want to list applications available for one or more specific boards, `use the nRF Connect for Visual Studio Code extension to filter them <Browse samples_>`_.
