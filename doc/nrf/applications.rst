Applications
############

Applications typically include a fully integrated software stack and can serve as a starting point for developing your product.
They use interface drivers and libraries from the |NCS| and its set of repositories to implement a specific use case.

Some applications target custom hardware designed for a specific use case.
They can also be run on different hardware like a generic development kit, but with limited functionality.
