Integrations
############

An |NCS| integration allows for using third-party and Nordic products within the |NCS|.
Integrations of the following third-party products are documented in their private repositories:

* Apple Find My
* ANT

In the case of Find My, MFi licensees can get access to the repository by issuing a Nordic `DevZone`_ private ticket.

.. note::
    Integrations are available also through the `nRF Connect SDK Add-ons`_, a curated collection of supplementary |NCS| components.
    For more information, including how to contribute your own add-on to the index, read :file:`README.md` and :file:`CONTRIBUTING.md` in the `ncs-app-index repository <ncs-app-index_>`_.
