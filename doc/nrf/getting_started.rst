Getting started
###############

This section is meant to help you get up to speed with developing applications in |NCS|.

After installing the |NCS|, you should follow these steps to start the developing process:

1. Find an example that does more or less what you need.
#. Program the unchanged example to your board.
#. Test to see if everything works.
#. Do small modifications to the example and program and test again.
#. Start implementing your changes.

The following sections will guide you through those steps.
