Getting started
###############

To quickly get started with the |NCS|, use :ref:`nRF Connect for Desktop <gs_assistant>` to set up your development environment.
Alternatively, you can enroll in the `nRF Connect SDK Fundamentals course`_ in the `Nordic Developer Academy`_.
You can also check the :ref:`gs_installing` documentation for instructions on setting up your environment manually.

We recommend using |VSC| with the |nRFVSC| to build applications.
See the `nRF Connect for Visual Studio Code`_ documentation page for more information about the extension.

.. note::
   Some samples in the |NCS| are currently not designed to work out-of-tree. You may need to manually configure your sample to work correctly in the |nRFVSC|.

Once you are set up, check out the :ref:`samples`.
If this is the first time you are working with embedded devices, it is probably a good idea to program an unchanged sample to your development kit first and test if it works as expected.
After that, pick a sample that is related to the application you want to create and start developing!
