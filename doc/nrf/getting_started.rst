Getting started
###############

To quickly get started with the |NCS|, use :ref:`nRF Connect for Desktop <gs_assistant>` to set up your development environment.
Alternatively, check the :ref:`gs_installing` section for instructions on setting up your environment manually.

We recommend using the `nRF Connect for Visual Studio Code`_ extension or |SES| to build applications.
See the |VSC| README file for more information about the extension.
See :ref:`gs_programming` for the |SES| instructions.

.. note::
   Some samples in the |NCS| are currently not designed to work out-of-tree. You may need to manually configure your sample to work correctly in the |VSC|.

Once you are set up, check out the :ref:`samples`.
If this is the first time you are working with embedded devices, it is probably a good idea to program an unchanged sample to your development kit first and test if it works as expected.
After that, pick a sample that is related to the application you want to create and start developing!
