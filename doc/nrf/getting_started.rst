Getting started
###############

To quickly get started with the |NCS|, use the `Getting Started Assistant <Getting Started Information_>`_ to set up your development environment.
Alternatively, check the :ref:`gs_installing` section for instructions on setting up your environment manually.

We recommend using SEGGER Embedded Studio for building your applications. See :ref:`gs_programming` for the download links and instructions.
In case you run into problems, see :ref:`gs_programming_ts` .

Once you are set up, check out the :ref:`samples`.
If this is the first time you work with embedded devices, it is probably a good idea to program an unchanged sample to your board first and test if it works as expected.
After that, pick a sample that is related to the application you want to create and start developing!
