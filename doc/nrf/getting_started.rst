Getting started
###############

To start working with the |NCS|, set up your development environment in one of the following ways:

* For automatic installation (recommended), use :ref:`nRF Connect for Desktop <gs_assistant>`
* For manual installation, refer to :ref:`gs_installing`

If you want to go through a dedicated training to familiarize yourself with the basic functionalities of the |NCS|, enroll in the `nRF Connect SDK Fundamentals course`_ in the `Nordic Developer Academy`_.

For building applications, we recommend using |VSC| with the |nRFVSC|.
For more information about the extension, see the `nRF Connect for Visual Studio Code`_ documentation page.

.. note::
   Some samples in the |NCS| are currently not designed to work out-of-tree. You may need to manually configure your sample to work correctly in the |nRFVSC|.

   If you are working with embedded devices, it is a good practice to first test your setup by programming an unchanged :ref:`sample<samples>` to your development kit.
