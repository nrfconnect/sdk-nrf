Introduction
************

nPM1300 is a Power Management IC (PMIC) with a linear-mode lithium-ion, lithium-polymer, and lithium ferro-phosphate battery charger.
It has two dual-mode buck regulators, two dual purpose LDO/load switches, three LED drivers and five GPIOs.

nPM1300 is the perfect companion for nRF52 and nRF53 Series SoCs, and the nRF91 series SiP.
It is ideal for compact and advanced IoT products such as wearables and portable medical applications.

For additional information, see the following documentation:

* :ref:`installation` and :ref:`configuration_and_build` documentation to install the |NCS| and learn more about its development environment.
* `nPM1300`_ for the technical documentation on the nPM1300 PMIC and associated kits.
