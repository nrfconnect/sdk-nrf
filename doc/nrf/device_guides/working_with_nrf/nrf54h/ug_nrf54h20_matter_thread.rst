Additional requirements on the nRF54H20 DK
******************************************

In addition to the standard requirements for the |NCS|, such as the :ref:`ug_matter_gs_tools_gn` for Matter, you need the following to run Matter-enabled or Thread-enabled applications on the nRF54H20 DK:

* For DFU - J-Link and a USB cable.
* nrfjprog from the `nRF Command Line Tools`_.

Configuring Matter and Thread on the nRF54H20 DK
************************************************

Currently, only the configuration for Matter over Thread is supported for Matter.
Follow the configuration steps on the :ref:`ug_matter_gs_testing` page to configure the Matter environment for the supported Matter samples.

Currently, only the :ref:`ot_cli_sample` sample is supported for Thread.
See the sample documentation for how to configure it.

The Matter and Thread samples can work on the corresponding networks with standard devices of the same protocol.

Programming Matter and Thread samples on the nRF54H20 DK
========================================================

To program the compatible Matter or Thread samples on the nRF54H20 DK, follow the :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_gs_sample` steps.
Read also programming guides prepared for specific Matter samples: :ref:`Matter door lock sample <matter_lock_sample>`, and :ref:`Matter template sample <matter_template_sample>`.

.. note::
   :ref:`Testing using Bluetooth LE with Nordic UART Service <matter_lock_sample_ble_nus>` on the :ref:`Matter door lock sample <matter_lock_sample>` is disabled by default.

Logging for Matter and Thread samples on the nRF54H20 DK
========================================================

To read logs for Matter samples on the nRF54H20 DK, complete the following steps:

1. Connect to the nRF54H20 DK using a USB cable.
#. Select the first available port to read the logs from.

For more information, see :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_logging`.

.. _ug_nrf54h20_matter_thread_matter_wifi:

Matter over Wi-Fi
=================

Matter over Wi-Fi is currently supported on the :ref:`Matter door lock sample <matter_lock_sample>` and :ref:`Matter template sample <matter_template_sample>`.

In this design, the Matter stack, the Wi-Fi stack, and the Bluetooth® Low Energy (LE) stack run on several cores and domains of a single nRF54H20 SoC.

To run Matter over Wi-Fi on the nRF54H20 DK you need the additional ``nrf7002_ek`` shield attached through the nRF54H20 DK to the nRF7002 EK interposer board.

In this design:

* The Application Core runs the Matter stack, the Wi-Fi stack, and a part of the Bluetooth LE Controller.
* The Radio Core runs both the Bluetooth LE Controller and the component of the OpenThread stack that is related to the 802.15.4 IEEE Radio Driver.
* The Secure Domain stores all the secure components, including keys and certificates.
  It also manages the access to peripherals, memory, and other components.

  .. note::
      The PSA crypto API level 3 for storing security components is not yet implemented on the Secure Domain.

* The Global Domain manages clocks, power, global RAM, and global NVM.

To build the sample with Matter over Wi-Fi support run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20_cpuapp -- -DCONF_FILE=prj_no_dfu.conf -DSHIELD=nrf700x_nrf54h20dk -DCONFIG_CHIP_WIFI=y

SUIT Device Firmware Upgrade support on the nRF54H20 DK
=======================================================

The :ref:`SUIT Device Firmware Upgrade <ug_nrf54h20_suit_dfu>` feature has been implemented on the nRF54H20 DK and you can use it in the :ref:`Matter door lock sample <matter_lock_sample>`.
In this solution, both Application and Radio Cores can be upgraded sequentially to the newest version using :ref:`SUIT hierarchical manifests <ug_nrf54h20_suit_hierarchical_manifests>`.
The SUIT DFU feature uses :ref:`SUIT manifests <ug_nrf54h20_suit_manifest_overview>` that contain components and images of the firmware and are used by the Secure Domain to replace, verify and run the firmware.
In the Matter Lock sample, we use the Simple Management Protocol (SMP) over Bluetooth LE transport to deliver the new firmware to the device's DFU partition and then the SUIT processor installs the image according to the instructions that are described in the manifest.
By default, the root manifest contains both Application and Radio Core images, but for the Matter sample the images need to be split to the separate cores and perform upgrades sequentially.
Currently, there is no protection against incompatibility between the new Radio Core and old Application Core images, so you need to ensure that compatibility.
We have prepared manifest templates in the ``configurations/nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20_cpuapp`` directory in the Matter lock sample which are prepared to generate two separate SUIT envelopes - one for the Application Core and another for the Radio Core. They are as follows:

   * :file:`app_envelope.yaml.jinja2` - Contains the procedures for SUIT directives that allow for the Application Core image to be updated.
   * :file:`app_envelope.yaml.jinja2.digest` - Contains the digital signature of the SUIT manifest prepared for the Application Core image.
   * :file:`multiprotocol_rad_envelope.yaml.jinja2` - Contains the procedures for SUIT directives that allow for the Radio Core image to be updated.
   * :file:`multiprotocol_rad_envelope.yaml.jinja2.digest` - Contains the digital signature of the SUIT manifest prepared for the Radio Core image.
   * :file:`root_hierarchical_envelope.yaml.jinja2` - Contains the procedures for SUIT directives to run the current firmware.
   * :file:`root_hierarchical_envelope.yaml.jinja2.digest` - Contains the digital signature of the SUIT manifest prepared for running the current firmware.

You can edit the templates for other purposes.
To learn how to do edit the manifest templates, see the :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_suit_customize_dfu` guide.

To build the firmware with the SUIT DFU support, run the following command with the *number* replaced with the new image number, that should be higher than the previous one:

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   west build -b nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20_cpuapp -- -DCONFIG_SUIT_ENVELOPE_SEQUENCE_NUM=*number*

You can perform a DFU using the nRF Connect Device Manager mobile application or the :ref:`Mcumgr command-line tool <zephyr:mcumgr_cli>`.
After building the sample you can find two SUIT envelopes created in the build directory and depending on the core type you can search for:

   * the :file:`build/zephyr/app.suit` file to get the SUIT envelope for the Application Core.
   * the :file:`build/multiprotocol_rpmsg/zephyr/multiprotocol_rpmsg_subimage.suit` file to get the SUIT envelope for the Radio Core.

To learn how to perform a DFU using the nRFConnect Device Manager mobile application read instructions in the ``suit smp transfer <nrf54h_suit_sample>`` guide.

Performing DFU on nRF54H20 DK using Mcumgr command-line tool
------------------------------------------------------------

   1. Follow the instructions in the :ref:`Mcumgr command-line tool <zephyr:mcumgr_cli>` guide to install Mcumgr.
   #. Press **Button 1** to enable Bluetooth LE SMP advertising on the nRF54H20 DK.
   #. Run the following command to upgrade the Radio Core:

      .. parsed-literal::
         :class: highlight

         mcumgr --conntype ble --hci *hci number* --connstring peer_name=*peer name* image upload *path to multiprotocol_rpmsg_subimage.suit* -n 0 -w 1

      Where:

      * *hci number* is the Bluetooth LE device ID on your host device (by default it is ``0``).
      * *peer name* is the Bluetooth LE name which is advertised by the nRF54H20 DK (by default ``"Matter Lock"``).
      * *path to multiprotocol_rpmsg_subimage.suit* is a path to the SUIT envelope that contains Radio Core image.

      For example:

      .. parsed-literal::
         :class: highlight

         mcumgr --conntype ble --hci 0 --connstring peer_name="MatterLock" image upload build/multiprotocol_rpmsg/zephyr/multiprotocol_rpmsg_subimage.suit -n 0 -w 1

   #. Press **Button 1** to enable Bluetooth LE SMP advertising on the nRF54H20 DK again, because the previous operation disabled it after applying the image.
   #. Run the same command as in Step 3 to upgrade the Application Core image, but this time provide a path to the ``app.suit`` file.

      For example:

      .. parsed-literal::
         :class: highlight

         mcumgr --conntype ble --hci 0 --connstring peer_name="MatterLock" image upload build/zephyr/app.suit -n 0 -w 1


Implementing support for the nRF54H20 DK
========================================

If you want to implement support for the nRF54H20 DK in your Matter-enabled or Thread-enabled application, read the :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_configuration` guide.

.. _ug_nrf54h20_matter_thread_limitations:

Limitations for Matter and Thread on the nRF54H20 DK
****************************************************

Matter and Thread support has the following limitations on the nRF54H20 DK:

* DFU over Matter or Serial Link is not yet implemented.
* The current implementation is not power-optimized.
* The cryptographic operations related to Matter and Thread are performed on the Application Core, rather than on the Secure Domain.
* The ``west flash --erase`` command is blocked.
  See :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_gs_sample` for more information.
* The factory reset functionality does not work properly.
  After clearing all NVM storage, the device can not reboot automatically and falls into a hard fault.

  As a workaround, press the reset button on the nRF54H20 DK board after performing a factory reset.
* Matter over Thread commissioning might be unstable due to the lack of true random generator support on nRF54H20.

  After each reboot or factory reset, the device will always have the same Bluetooth LE and IEEE 80215.4 addresses.
  This might impact working within the Thread network because after the second and following connections, Thread Border Router will reject these connections until deleted from the database and commissioning to Matter will take more and more time.

  As a workaround, after each factory reset and before performing the next commissioning to Matter, connect to the device's serial port and run the following command:

    .. parsed-literal::
       :class: highlight

       ot extaddr *address*

  Replace the *address* argument with an 8-byte randomly generated MAC address, for example ``87fb47d5730ac0a0``.
