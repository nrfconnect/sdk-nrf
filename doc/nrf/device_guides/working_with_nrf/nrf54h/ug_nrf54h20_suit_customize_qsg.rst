Customize SUIT DFU quick start guide
####################################

This quick start guide explains how to customize the Software Update for Internet of Things (SUIT) Device Firmware Update (DFU) to target your specific nRF54H20 System-on-Chip (SoC).
It is aimed at users new to the SUIT DFU process.

Overview
********

The following are basic SUIT concepts you need to understand to be able to customize SUIT DFU for your device:

* SUIT uses envelopes that serve as a secure transport container, and the SUIT manifest contains crucial deployment metadata.

* SUIT envelopes are generated from manifest templates.

* The SUIT manifest is like a blueprint that tells the system how to create a SUIT envelope, and contains instructions and metadata for the DFU procedure.

* Default SUIT manifest templates are provided, but customization, especially for UUIDs, is recommended.

* The manifest templates are automatically created and copied to the sample directory on the first build of SUIT samples.

   Overview of the SUIT DFU procedure

See the :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_suit_intro` for more information about SUIT-specific concepts.

SUIT DFU process
================

The SUIT DFU process involves creating a SUIT envelope, which includes a manifest outlining the steps for the update.
When you first build the SUIT sample in the |NCS|, you receive default manifest templates which you can customize according to your project's requirements.
This guide will walk you through how to customize the SUIT manifest to target your specific device.

For a complete guide on all customizable aspects of the SUIT DFU procedure, see the :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_suit_customize_dfu` user guide.

Requirements
************

For this quick start guide, you need the following development kit:

+------------------------+----------+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| **Hardware platforms** | **PCA**  | **Board name**                 | **Build target**              |
+========================+==========+================================+===============================+
| nRF54H20 DK            | PCA10175 | ``nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20_cpuapp`` | ``nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20_cpuapp``|
+------------------------+----------+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+

Software requirements
=====================

For this quick start guide, we will install the following software:

* Toolchain Manager - An application for installing the full |NCS| toolchain.
* Microsoft's |VSC| - The recommended IDE for the |NCS|.
* |nRFVSC| - An add-on for |VSC| that allows you to develop applications for the |NCS|.
* nRF Command Line Tools - A set of mandatory tools for working with the |NCS|.
* Any additional requirements described in the ``nrf54h_suit_sample` sample``.

Building the SUIT sample
************************

Start by building the SUIT sample:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20_cpuapp nrf/samples/suit/smp_transfer

This command builds the SUIT sample for the nRF54H20 SoC.

Modifying class and vendor identifiers
**************************************

The next step involves customizing identifiers in the manifest:

1. Open the manifest template file located at `nrf/samples/suit/smp_transfer/app_envelope.yaml.jinja2`.
#. Find the ``class-identifier`` and ``vendor-identifier`` entries in the :file:`.yaml.jinja2` file.
#. Replace default values with unique identifiers for your application, like so:

.. code-block::

  - suit-directive-override-parameters:
      suit-parameter-vendor-identifier:
         RFC4122_UUID: ACME Corp              # Changed vendor-identifier value
      suit-parameter-class-identifier:
         RFC4122_UUID:                        # Changed class-identifier values
           namespace: ACME Corp
           name: Light bulb

.. note::
   Replacing and using the correct UUIDs prevent conflicts in the DFU process.

With the sample built and identifiers customized, your SUIT DFU process is now specifically configured for your nRF54H20 SoC.

Next steps
**********

The SUIT DFU procedure can further be customized by:

* Creating and modifying your own manifests
* Generating raw UUID values
* Changing the default location of the manifests

Instructions for these actions and further customization are described in the :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_suit_customize_dfu`.
Additionally, you can modify SUIT components within the manifest (see the :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_suit_components` page for more information).
