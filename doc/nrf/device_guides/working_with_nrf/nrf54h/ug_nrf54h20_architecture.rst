The nRF54H20 is a multicore System-on-Chip (SoC) that uses an asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) configuration.
Each core is tasked with specific responsibilities, and is optimized for different workloads.

The following pages briefly describe topics like the responsibilities of the cores, their interprocessor interactions, the memory mapping, and the boot sequence in the nRF54H20 SoC.
