.. _ug_nrf9160_gs_testing_gnss:

Testing the GNSS functionality
==============================

:ref:`asset_tracker_v2` supports acquiring GNSS position and transmitting it to nRF Cloud.

To achieve the fastest Time To First Fix of GNSS position, the following conditions need to be met:

* The device must be able to connect to nRF Cloud.
  You can confirm this by checking whether the status of your DK is displayed correctly on the nRF Cloud portal.
  The cloud connection is used to download GPS assistance data.
* Your network operator should support Power Saving Mode (PSM) or Extended Discontinuous Reception (eDRX) with the SIM card that you are using.
  If you are using an iBasis SIM card, check the `iBasis network coverage spreadsheet`_ to see the supported features and network coverage for different countries.

  The device may be able to acquire a GNSS position fix even if the network does not support PSM or eDRX for your SIM card, but it will likely take longer to do so.

For best results retrieving GNSS data, place the nRF9160 DK outside with a clear view of the sky.
It might also work indoors if the device is near a window.

Complete the following steps to test the GNSS functionality:

1. If you have an external antenna for your nRF9160 DK, attach it to connector **J2** to the left of the LTE antenna.
   See `nRF9160 DK GPS`_ for more information.
#. Turn on or reset your DK.
#. Log in to the `nRF Cloud`_ portal.
#. Click :guilabel:`Devices` under :guilabel:`Device Management` in the navigation pane on the left.
