The nRF9161 DK is a hardware development platform used to design and develop application firmware on the nRF9161 :term:`System in Package (SiP)`.
The nRF9161 SiP is a low power SiP with integrated DECT NR+ modem and 3GPP Release 14 LTE-M/NB-IoT with GNSS.

See the `nRF9161 DK Hardware`_ guide for detailed information about the nRF9161 DK hardware.
To get started with the nRF9161 DK, complete the steps in the Quick Start app in `nRF Connect for Desktop`_.
If you are not familiar with the |NCS|, see :ref:`installation` and :ref:`configuration_and_build` documentation to install the |NCS| and learn more about its development environment.

.. _nrf9161_ug_intro:

Board controller
****************

The nRF9161 DK contains an nRF5340 Interface MCU (IMCU), which acts both as an on-board debugger and board controller.
The board controller controls signal switches on the nRF9161 DK and can be used to route the nRF9161 SiP pins to different components on the DK, such as pin headers, external memory, a SIM card or eSIM.
For a complete list of configuration options available, see the nRF9161 DK board control section in the nRF9161 DK User Guide.

The nRF5340 IMCU comes preprogrammed with J-Link SEGGER OB and board controller firmware.
If you want to change the default configuration of the DK, you can use the Board Configurator app in `nRF Connect for Desktop`_ .
See the `nRF Connect Board Configurator`_ documentation for instructions on how to change the configuration of the DK.

==================================================

.. include:: nrf9160.rst
   :start-after: dk_cloud_cer_download_start
   :end-before: dk_cloud_cer_download_end

Provisioning the nRF Cloud certificate
======================================

After downloading the certificate, you must provision it to your nRF9161 DK.

Complete the following steps to provision the certificate:

1. Start nRF Connect for Desktop and install the `Cellular Monitor`_ app.
#. Open the Cellular Monitor app.
#. Connect the DK to the computer with a USB-C cable, and turn it on.
#. Click :guilabel:`Select device` and select the DK from the drop-down list.

   .. figure:: images/cellularmonitor_selectdevice_nrf9161.png

      Cellular Monitor - Open Serial Terminal

#. Enter ``AT+CFUN=4`` in the text field for AT commands and click :guilabel:`Send`.
   This AT command puts the modem to offline state.
#. Enter ``AT+CFUN?`` in the text field for AT commands and click :guilabel:`Send`.
   This AT command returns the state of the modem.

   The command must return ``+CFUN: 4``, which indicates that the modem is in offline state.
   If it returns a different value, repeat the previous step.
#. Open the Cellular Monitor app.
#. Click :guilabel:`CERTIFICATE MANAGER` in the navigation bar to switch to the certificate manager view.

   .. figure:: images/cellularmonitor_navigationcertificatemanager_nrf9161.png

#. Click :guilabel:`Load from JSON` and select the :file:`*.cert.json` file that you downloaded from nRF Cloud.
   Alternatively, you can drag and drop the file onto the GUI.
#. Ensure that the **Security tag** is set to ``16842753``, which is the security tag for nRF Cloud credentials.
#. Click :guilabel:`Update certificate`.

   The log message "Certificate update completed" indicates that the certificate was provisioned successfully.
   If you encounter any errors, switch to the terminal view and check the output of the AT commands that were sent to the nRF9161 DK modem.

   .. note::

      If you have connected your nRF9161 DK to nRF Cloud before, you must delete the device there after provisioning the certificate.
      Open the entry for your device from the **Devices** view, then click the gear icon to the right of the device's name, and select :guilabel:`Delete Device`.
      Then, add the nRF9161 DK again to the nRF cloud.


Build targets
*************

Make sure to select a suitable build target when building your application.

In Zephyr, the firmware for the application core of :ref:`zephyr:nrf9161dk_nrf9161` is divided into two different build targets:

* ``nrf9161dk/nrf9161`` for build targets that have Cortex-M Security Extensions (CMSE) disabled.
* ``nrf9161dk/nrf9161/ns`` for build targets that have CMSE enabled and have the Secure Processing Environment (SPE) firmware alongside the Non-Secure Processing Environment (NSPE) firmware.

For information about CMSE and the difference between the two environments, see :ref:`app_boards_spe_nspe`.
