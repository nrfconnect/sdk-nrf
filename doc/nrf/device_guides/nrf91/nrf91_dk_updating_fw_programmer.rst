Before you begin to update the firmware, download and extract the latest application and modem firmware from the `nRF9160 DK Downloads`_ page.

The downloaded ZIP archive contains the following firmware:

Application firmware
  The :file:`img_app_bl` folder contains full firmware images for different applications.
  The guides in this section use the image for the :ref:`asset_tracker_v2` application as an example.
  Asset Tracker v2 simulates sensor data and transmits it to Nordic Semiconductor's cloud solution, `nRF Cloud`_.

  The data is transmitted using either LTE-M or NB-IoT.
  Asset Tracker v2 first attempts to use LTE-M, then NB-IoT.
  Check with your SIM card provider for the mode they support at your location.

  .. tabs::

     .. group-tab:: nRF9161 DK

        For the Onomondo SIM card, check the `Onomondo LTE-M coverage`_ and `Onomondo NB-IoT coverage`_ to see the network coverage for different countries.

     .. group-tab:: nRF9160 DK

        For the iBasis SIM card provided with the nRF9160 DK, see `iBasis IoT network coverage`_.

Application firmware for Device Firmware Update (DFU)
  The images in the :file:`img_fota_dfu_bin` and :file:`img_fota_dfu_hex` folders contain firmware images for DFU.
  These images are not used in the guides in this section.

Modem firmware
  The modem firmware is in a ZIP archive instead of a folder.
  The archive is named :file:`mfw_nrf9160_` or :file:`mfw_nrf91x1_`, followed by the firmware version number.
  Do not unzip this file.

.. tip::
   For a more compact nRF Cloud firmware application, you can build and install the :ref:`nrf_cloud_multi_service` sample.
   See :ref:`building` for details on building a firmware sample application.

The :file:`CONTENTS.txt` file in the extracted folder contains the location and names of the different firmware images.

Complete the steps in the following sections to program applications using the Programmer app from `nRF Connect for Desktop`_.
You will need the following USB cables for this purpose:

* nRF9161 DK: USB-C cable
* nRF9160 DK: micro-USB cable

Updating the modem firmware
***************************

To update the modem firmware, complete the following steps.

.. tip::
    If you experience any problems during the process, press ``Ctrl+R`` (``command+R`` on macOS) to restart the Programmer app and try again.

1. Open the Programmer app.
#. For the nRF9160 DK only: Make sure the **PROG/DEBUG SW10** switch on the nRF9160 DK is set to **nRF91**.
   On DK v0.9.0 and earlier, this is the **SW5** switch.
#. Connect the DK to the computer with a USB cable, and then turn the DK on.
#. Click :guilabel:`SELECT DEVICE` and select the DK from the drop-down list.

            Programmer - Select device

   The drop-down text changes to the type of the selected device, with its SEGGER ID below the name.
   The **Device memory layout** section also changes its name to the device name, and indicates that the device is connected.
   If the :guilabel:`Auto read memory` option is selected in the **J-LINK SETTINGS** section of the side panel, the memory layout will update.
   If it is not selected and you wish to see the memory layout, click :guilabel:`Read` in the **DEVICE** section of the side panel.

#. Click :guilabel:`Add file` in the **FILE** section, and select :guilabel:`Browse`.
#. Navigate to where you extracted the firmware, and select the file for your DK:

   * nRF9160 DK: :file:`mfw_nrf9160_<version-number>.zip`
   * nRF91x1 DK: :file:`mfw_nrf91x1_<version-number>.zip`

#. Click :guilabel:`Write` in the **DEVICE** section of the side panel.

#. Ignore the warning message and click the :guilabel:`Write` button in the **Modem DFU** window to update the firmware.
   Do not unplug or turn off the device during this process.

When the update is complete, you see a success message.
If you update the application firmware now, you can skip the initial steps about connecting and selecting the device in :ref:`nrf9160_updating_fw_application`.

.. note::

   If you experience problems updating the modem firmware, click :guilabel:`Erase all` in the **DEVICE** section of the side panel and try updating again.

Updating the application firmware
*********************************

To update the application firmware using the Programmer app, complete the following steps.

.. tip::
    If you experience any problems during the process, press ``Ctrl+R`` (``command+R`` on macOS) to restart the Programmer app and try again.

1. Open the Programmer app.
#. For the nRF9160 DK only: Make sure the **PROG/DEBUG SW10** switch (**SW5** on DK v0.9.0 and earlier) on the nRF9160 DK is set to **nRF91** or **nRF52** as appropriate for the application or sample you are programming.
   See the `Device programming section in the nRF9160 DK User Guide`_ for more information.

   For the :ref:`asset_tracker_v2` application, the switch must be set to **nRF91**.

#. Connect the DK to the computer with a USB cable, and then turn the DK on.
#. Click :guilabel:`SELECT DEVICE` and select the DK from the drop-down list.

   If the :guilabel:`Auto read memory` option is selected in the **J-LINK SETTINGS** section, the memory layout will update.
   If it is not selected and you wish to see the memory layout, click :guilabel:`Read` in the **DEVICE** section.

#. Click :guilabel:`Add file` in the **FILE** section, and select :guilabel:`Browse`.
#. Navigate to where you extracted the firmware, and then to the :file:`img_app_bl` folder there.
#. Select the :file:`.hex` file for your DK for the application you are programming:

   * nRF9160 DK: :file:`nrf9160dk_asset_tracker_v2_<version-number>.hex`
   * nRF91x1 DK: :file:`nrf9161dk_asset_tracker_v2_<version-number>.hex`

   For NB-IoT, there is a second variant of the Asset Tracker v2 firmware in the file ending with :file:`*_nbiot_legacy_pco_<version-number>.hex`.
   Only use this legacy variant if your network does not support ePCO.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Erase & write` button in the **DEVICE** section to program the DK.
