Release notes
#############

See the release notes for information about specific |NCS| releases.

Known issues for each release are listed on the `known issues page on the master branch`_.
This page is included only in the latest documentation, because it might contain issues that are discovered after a release is tagged.

.. important::
   A "99" at the end of the version number of this documentation indicates continuous updates on the master branch since the previous major.minor release.
   Changes between releases that are merged into the master branch are tracked on the :ref:`ncs_release_notes_latest` page, which is available only in the "99" version of documentation.

   Note that there might be additional changes on the master branch that are not listed on that page.
