Driving a GPIO pin directly

This user guide shows how to control a GPIO pin directly using GPIO driver APIs.
In the development phase of an embedded project, you can use this configuration to set the pin state using software, without any intermediary circuitry or additional hardware components.
You can use this solution to collect execution timings, or as a debugging tool.

You can copy the following configuration snippets manually into the devicetree overlay files.
You can also use the `Devicetree Visual Editor <How to work with Devicetree Visual Editor_>`_ (either in GUI or text mode) in the |nRFVSC| to apply them.

.. rst-class:: numbered-step

Define the compatible DTS node
******************************

You need to define a new GPIO pin devicetree node for the pin.
The devicetree node needs to be compatible with the GPIO devicetree binding.
GPIO APIs use the devicetree node to refer to the specified GPIO pin.

If you work with a Nordic Semiconductor device, you can use the binding definition in :file:`nrf/dts/bindings/gpio`.

See Zephyr's documentation about :ref:`zephyr:devicetree` and :ref:`zephyr:gpio_api` for more information.

.. rst-class:: numbered-step

Configure the GPIO pin through DTS
**********************************

To declare a GPIO pin node, create a DTS node in the DTS of your board or application's DTS overlay.
Pins defined this way can be accessed using the :ref:`GPIO devicetree APIs<zephyr:gpio_api>`.

Make sure that GPIO ports used by the GPIO pins are enabled.
The following snippet shows the declaration of a GPIO pin node called ``user_dbg_pin``:

.. code-block:: c

	/ {
		user_dbg_pin: user-dbg-pin {
			compatible = "nordic,gpio-pins";
			gpios = <&gpio0 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
			status = "okay";
		};
	};

	&gpio0 {
		status = "okay";
	};

	&gpiote0 {
		status = "okay";
	};

In this snippet:

* The GPIO pin node is labelled as ``user_dbg_pin`` (with the ``user-dbg-pin`` node name).

  * ``compatible`` specifies the binding definition to be used (``nordic,gpio-pins`` from :file:`nrf/dts/bindings/gpio`).
  * ``gpios`` specifies which pin node is being used (**Pin 2** of **GPIO0**).
  * ``status`` enables the pin node when it is set to ``"okay"``.

* Additionally, the ``gpio0`` and ``gpiote0`` instances are enabled, so the GPIO driver can be built and executed.

.. rst-class:: numbered-step

Include the pin in your application
***********************************

To let your application access the declared pins, use the following devicetree macros:

1. Declare a GPIO struct instance in your application to allow the GPIO driver API to access the pin:

   .. code-block:: c

       #include <zephyr/drivers/gpio.h>
       static const struct gpio_dt_spec pin_dbg =
          GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET_OR(DT_NODELABEL(user_dbg_pin), gpios, {0});

#. Make sure your application initializes the pin using the :c:func:`gpio_pin_configure_dt` function:

   .. code-block:: c

       if (pin_dbg.port) {
          gpio_pin_configure_dt(&pin_dbg, GPIO_OUTPUT_INACTIVE);
    }

#. Add the following code where needed to let your application drive the pin using the :c:func:`gpio_pin_set_dt` function:

   .. code-block:: c

      if (pin_dbg.port) {
         gpio_pin_set_dt(&pin_dbg, 1);
      }
      ...
      if (pin_dbg.port) {
         gpio_pin_set_dt(&pin_dbg, 0);
      }

The snippets above show an easy way of generating a square wave that reflects your software execution timings and state.
Such a plot can be observed using a logic analyzer or an oscilloscope.
Additionally, the code rendered through the snippets is dependent on the binding existence ``if (pin_dbg.port)``.
This means the snippets will be inactive when you build your application without declaring ``user-dbg-pin``.
This is an easy way to disable this debugging infrastructure.

Declaring multiple pins
***********************

You can also declare multiple pins in one GPIO property.
See the following code snippet:

.. code-block:: c

	/ {
		user_dbg_pin: user-dbg-pin {
			compatible = "nordic,gpio-pins";
			gpios = <&gpio0 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>, <&gpio0 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
			gpio-names = "enter", "exit";
			status = "okay";
		};
	};

To initialize the defined GPIO pin structures, use the :c:macro:`GPIO_DT_SPEC_INST_GET_BY_IDX_OR` macro:

.. code-block:: c

   #include <zephyr/drivers/gpio.h>
   static const struct gpio_dt_spec pin_dbg0 =
       GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET_BY_IDX_OR(DT_NODELABEL(user_dbg_pin), gpios, 0, {0});
   static const struct gpio_dt_spec pin_dbg1 =
	   GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET_BY_IDX_OR(DT_NODELABEL(user_dbg_pin), gpios, 1, {0});

The rest of the GPIO pin operations follow the same process in case of declaring a single pin.
