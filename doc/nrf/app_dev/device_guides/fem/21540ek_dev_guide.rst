The nRF21540 :term:`Evaluation Kit (EK)` is an RF :term:`Front-End Module (FEM)` for Bluetooth Low Energy, Bluetooth Mesh, 2.4 GHz proprietary, Thread, and Zigbee range extension.
When combined with an nRF52 or nRF53 Series SoC, the nRF21540 RF FEM's +21 dBm TX output power and 13 dB RX gain ensure a superior link budget for up to 16x range extension.

   nRF21540 EK shield

You can learn more about the nRF21540 EK in the `nRF21540 Front-End Module`_ (including its pin layout) and `nRF21540 EK User Guide`_ hardware documentation.

Building and programming with nRF21540 EK
*****************************************

To build for the nRF21540 EK, build for the compatible :ref:`nRF52 or nRF53 board target <app_boards_names>` with the CMake ``SHIELD`` option set to ``nrf21540ek``.
See :ref:`cmake_options` for instructions on how to provide CMake options.

For example, if you build for nRF52840 DK on the command line, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf52840dk/nrf52840 -- -DSHIELD=nrf21540ek

If you use the |nRFVSC|, specify ``-DSHIELD=nrf21540ek`` in the **Extra Cmake arguments** field when `setting up a build configuration <How to work with build configurations_>`_.

Alternatively, add the shield in the project's :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file:

.. code-block:: none

   set(SHIELD nrf21540ek)

Building for a multicore board
==============================

When building for a board with an additional network core, like the nRF5340, add the ``-DSHIELD`` parameter to the command line:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DSHIELD=nrf21540ek

In this case, the sysbuild will pass the *SHIELD=nrf21540ek* variable to all images that are built by the command.
The build system will pick automatically appropriate overlay and configuration files for images for each core.
Please note that the files are different for each of the cores.
For the application core the overlay containing forwarding the FEM pins to the network core will be used.
For the network core the overlay enabling nRF21540 FEM on the network core will be used.
In case the application contains additional images for which the *SHIELD* variable should not be passed, you must pass manually the *SHIELD* variable to each relevant image build separately.

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -D<app_name_image>_SHIELD=nrf21540ek -Dipc_radio_SHIELD=nrf21540ek

In this case the *SHIELD=nrf21540ek* will be passed to the build of the *app_image_name* image for the application core.
The build system will pick automatically an overlay file containing forwarding the FEM pins to the network core.
The *SHIELD=nrf21540ek* variable will be passed to the build of the ``ipc_radio`` image for the network core.
The build system will pick automatically an overlay file enabling nRF21540 FEM on the network core.

In this command, the ``ipc_radio`` image us used as default and builds the network core image with support for the combination of 802.15.4 and Bluetooth.
The ``ipc_radio`` has been used since the build system migration to sysbuild.
See :ref:`Migrating to sysbuild <child_parent_to_sysbuild_migration>` page.
Setting the correct sysbuild option enables support for 802.15.4 and Bluetooth :ref:`ipc_radio`.

``ipc_radio`` represents all applications with support for the combination of both 802.15.4 and Bluetooth.
You can configure your application using the following sysbuild configurations:

* ``SB_CONFIG_NETCORE_IPC_RADIO=y`` for applications having support for 802.15.4, but not for Bluetooth.
* ``SB_CONFIG_NETCORE_IPC_RADIO_BT_HCI_IPC=y`` for application having support for Bluetooth, but not for 802.15.4.
* ``SB_CONFIG_NETCORE_IPC_RADIO=y`` and ``SB_CONFIG_NETCORE_IPC_RADIO_BT_HCI_IPC=y`` for multiprotocol applications having support for both 802.15.4 and Bluetooth.


.. note::
   On nRF53 devices, ``SPIM0`` and ``UARTE0`` are mutually exclusive AHB bus masters on the network core as described in the `Product Specification <nRF5340 Product Specification_>`_, Section 6.4.3.1, Table 22.
   As a result, they cannot be used simultaneously.
   For the SPI part of the nRF21540 interface to be functional, you must disable the ``UARTE0`` node in the network core's devicetree file.

   .. code-block:: devicetree

      &uart0 {
         status = "disabled";
      };
