Performing KMU provisioning

The nRF54L devices are equipped with Hardware Key Management Unit (KMU), that requires provisioning when in use.
The |NCS| provides a west command, ``ncs-provision``, allowing to upload keys to the device though the Serial Write Debug (SWD) interface.

Prerequisites
*************

First, ensure that the `nRF Util`_ tool is installed.
It should install automatically during the setup of the |NCS| working environment.
Once completed, install the required additional commands for nRF Util:

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

    nrfutil install device

Key generation
**************

If you need a new key, you can generate it using imgtool or another tool that produces the required kind and format of key.
For instructions on how to generate a key, see the :doc:`imgtool page in the MCUboot documentation<mcuboot:imgtool>`.
See the following example for generating a private key:

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   imgtool keygen -k my_ed25519_priv_key.pem -t ed25519

Provisioning keys to the board
******************************

Before uploading keys, ensure that the SoC is unprovisioned.
If the SoC has been previously provisioned and you need to use a different set of keys, you must first erase the SoC with the erase command:

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: erase using nrfutil

      .. parsed-literal::
         :class: highlight

          nrfutil device erase

    .. group-tab:: erase using nrfjprog

      .. parsed-literal::
         :class: highlight

          nrfjprog --eraseall

Once you have an unprovisioned SoC, upload keys to the board by running the following command:

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

    west ncs-provision upload -s nrf54l15 -k ed25519.pem -k ed25519-1.pem -k ed25519-2.pem --keyname UROT_PUBKEY

* Parameter ``-s (-–soc)`` specifies the target device.

* Parameter ``-k (-–key)`` specifies the private key PEM files to be provisioned to the SoC.
  You can specify up to three keys.

* Parameter ``--keyname`` specifies the key name for which the key PEM files will be uploaded.

* Parameter ``--dev-id`` specifies the interface serial number and should be used if multiple J-link interfaces are connected to the development machine.

* Parameter ``-p (--policy)`` specifies the policy applied to the given set of keys.
  You can apply the following options:

      * ``lock-last`` - Uploads the last key as locked, while the preceding keys are revocable. This option is set by default.
      * ``revokable`` - Enables revocation for each key.
      * ``lock`` - Sets all keys to be permanent.

* Parameter ``--build-dir`` specifies the path to a directory where a JSON file for nRF Util tool will be created.
  If this parameter is not provided, a temporary directory will be used instead.

* Parameter ``-i (--input)`` specifies path to a YAML file that contains one or more key definitions intended for upload.
  This file can serve as a substitute for other parameters.

  The YAML file should look as follows:

   .. code-block:: YAML

      - keyname: UROT_PUBKEY
          keys: ["/path/private-key1.pem", "/path/private-key2.pem"]
          policy: lock
      - keyname: APP_PUBKEY
          keys: ["/path/private-key3.pem", "/path/private-key4.pem"]
          policy: lock

* Parameter ``--dry-run`` specifies that a command should generate a keyfile for nRF Util without actually executing the command.

The script generates the public key for each private key and uploads them to your device.
These public keys generate the verification keys for the application image, which are then used by MCUboot for validation.
The first key specified in the command is used for signing the application image.
Currently, the script supports only ED25519 Keys.

For MCUboot, take note of the following:

* By default, it uses one key.
* KMU support in its configuration needs to be enabled by setting the ``SB_CONFIG_MCUBOOT_SIGNATURE_USING_KMU`` sysbuild Kconfig option.
  Otherwise, MCUboot will fallback to the compiled in key.

For provision one key to the board run the following command:

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

    west ncs-provision upload -s nrf54l15 -k ed25519.pem --keyname UROT_PUBKEY
