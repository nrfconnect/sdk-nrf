The nRF54L15 DK embeds an Arm® Cortex®-M33 processor with multiprotocol 2.4 GHz transceiver and supports Bluetooth® 5.4.

For additional information, see the following documentation:

* Zephyr page on the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54l15dk_nrf54l15`
* :ref:`installation` and :ref:`configuration_and_build` documentation to install the |NCS| and learn more about its development environment.

Supported protocols
*******************

The nRF54L15 DK supports Bluetooth Low Energy (LE), proprietary protocols (including Enhanced ShockBurst), Matter, and Thread.

Amazon Sidewalk
===============

Amazon Sidewalk is a shared network designed to provide a stable and reliable connection to your device.
Ring and Echo device can act as a gateway, meaning they can share a portion of internet bandwidth providing the connection and services to Sidewalk end devices.
Amazon Sidewalk for the nRF Connect SDK is based on two variants, one using Bluetooth® LE (more suited for home applications) and the other one using sub-GHz with the Semtech radio transceiver (for applications requiring longer range).

To learn more about the Amazon Sidewalk solution, see the `Amazon Sidewalk documentation`_ page.

Bluetooth Low Energy
====================

The Bluetooth LE radio is designed for very low-power operation.
When you develop a Bluetooth LE application, you must use the Bluetooth software stack.
This stack is split into two core components: the Bluetooth Host and the Bluetooth LE Controller.
The :ref:`ug_ble_controller` user guide contains more information about the two available Bluetooth LE Controllers, and instructions for switching between them.

See the :ref:`zephyr:bluetooth` section of the Zephyr documentation for information on the Bluetooth Host and open source Bluetooth LE Controller.
The |NCS| contains :ref:`ble_samples` that can be run on the nRF54L15 DK device.
In addition, you can run the :ref:`zephyr:bluetooth-samples` that are included from Zephyr.

For available libraries, see :ref:`lib_bluetooth_services` (|NCS|) and :ref:`zephyr:bluetooth_api` (Zephyr).

Enhanced ShockBurst
===================

.. include:: ../../../protocols/esb/index.rst
   :start-after: esb_intro_start
   :end-before: esb_intro_end

See the :ref:`ug_esb` user guide for information about how to work with Enhanced ShockBurst.
To start developing, check out the :ref:`esb_ptx` and :ref:`esb_prx` samples.

Matter
======

.. include:: ../../../protocols/matter/index.rst
   :start-after: matter_intro_start
   :end-before: matter_intro_end

Matter in the |NCS| supports the *System-on-Chip, multiprotocol* platform design for the nRF54L15 SoC using Matter over Thread.
You can read more about other available platform designs for Matter on the :ref:`Matter platform design page<ug_matter_overview_architecture_integration_designs>`.
For more information about the multiprotocol feature, see :ref:`ug_multiprotocol_support`.

See the :ref:`ug_matter` user guide for information about how to work with Matter applications.
To start developing, check the :ref:`matter_samples`.

Thread
======

.. include:: ../../../protocols/thread/index.rst
   :start-after: thread_intro_start
   :end-before: thread_intro_end

You can read more about other available platform designs for Thread on the :ref:`OpenThread architectures page<ug_thread_architectures>`.
For more information about the multiprotocol feature, see :ref:`ug_multiprotocol_support`.

To start developing, check out the :ref:`openthread_samples`.

Near Field Communication
========================

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a technology for wireless transfer of small amounts of data between two devices that are in close proximity.
The range of NFC is typically less than 10 cm.

Refer to the :ref:`ug_nfc` page for general information.
See the :ref:`nfc_samples` and :ref:`lib_nfc` for the samples and libraries that the |NCS| provides.

MCUboot bootloader support
**************************

The nRF54L15 DK supports MCUboot as its bootloader, in the experimental phase.
This means the following:

  * Only software cryptography is supported.
  * Single image pair is supported for dual-bank Device Firmware Update (DFU) targeted at the CPU application (the ``nrf54l15dk/nrf54l15/cpuapp`` board target).
  * MCUboot can be configured as a first-stage bootloader (second-stage bootloader functionality is not yet available).
  * Serial recovery mode is also not yet supported.

Supported DFU protocols
=======================

The DFU process in the nRF54L15 DK uses the MCUmgr protocol.
It can be used for performing updates over Bluetooth® Low Energy (LE) and serial connections.

For instructions on testing, see :ref:`nrf54l_testing_dfu`.
