Global Resource configuration
*****************************

|ISE| uses the User Information Configuration Registers (UICR) to securely configure persistent global resource settings.
The UICR is a dedicated non-volatile memory region (and its associated registers) located in the first NVR page (NVR0).
It holds device-specific configuration data, such as application-owned memory boundaries and selected peripheral parameters, which are used to configure the system before the application starts.

.. note::
   When you configure a custom devicetree for your board, the build system automatically generates UICR content based on the devicetree configuration.

The following UICR fields are supported:

+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| UICR Field           | Description                                                         |

+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. note::
   If no UICR values are programmed, |ISE| applies a set of default configurations.
   Applications that do not require custom settings can rely on these defaults without modifying the UICR.

UICR.VERSION
============

UICR.VERSION specifies the version of the UICR format in use.
It is divided into a 16-bit major version and a 16-bit minor version.

This versioning scheme allows IronSide to support multiple UICR formats, enabling updates to the format without breaking compatibility with existing configurations.

UICR.LOCK
=========

Enabling UICR.LOCK locks the entire contents of the NVR0 page located in MRAM10.
This includes all values in both the UICR and the BICR (the Board Information Configuration Registers).
When UICR.LOCK is enabled, you can modify the UICR only by performing an ERASEALL operation.

.. note::
   While BICR is not erased during an ERASEALL operation, executing ERASEALL lifts the UICR.LOCK restriction, allowing write access to BICR.

Locking is enforced through an integrity check and by configuring the NVR page as read-only in the MRAMC.

If the integrity check fails, the application is booted with the application domain's CPUWAIT set.
It is not possible to boot the vendor-specified recovery firmware if the integrity check fails.

UICR.APPROTECT
==============

You can configure several access ports (APs) through UICR.
UICR.APPROTECT controls debugger access when connected to an AP, specifically the settings in the TAMPC peripheral.
Set all APs to UICR_APPROTECT_PROTECTED to get a protected device.

The following table shows the configuration of the TAMPC peripheral for each AP.

+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------------------------------+
|                TAMPC.DOMAIN[n]                |   TAMPC.AP[n]         | Configuration                 |

| DBGEN     | NIDEN     | SPIDEN    | SPNIDEN   | DBGEN     | SPIDEN    |                               |
+===========+===========+===========+===========+===========+===========+===============================+
|     0     |     0     |     0     |     0     |     0     |     0     | UICR_APPROTECT_PROTECTED      |

|     0     |     0     |     0     |     0     |     0     | UICR_APPROTECT_PROTECTED       |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------+
|     1     |     1     |     1     |     1     |     1     | UICR_APPROTECT_UNPROTECTED     |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------+

UICR.ERASEPROTECT
=================

Enabling UICR.ERASEPROTECT blocks the ERASEALL operation.
However, it does not prevent erase operations initiated through other means, such as writing erase values via a debugger.

.. note::
   If this configuration is enabled and UICR.LOCK is also set, it is no longer possible to modify the UICR in any way.
   Therefore, this configuration should only be enabled during the final stages of production.

UICR.PROTECTEDMEM
=================

In the UICR.PROTECTEDMEM field, you can specify a memory region that will have its integrity ensured by |ISE|.
This memory can contain immutable bootloaders, UICR.PERIPHCONF entries, UICR.MPCCONF entries, or any other data that should be immutable.
By ensuring the integrity of this memory region, |ISE| extends the Root of Trust to any immutable bootloader located in this region.

The value in this field specifies the number of 4 kB blocks, starting from the lowest MRAM address of the application-owned memory.

UICR.PERIPHCONF
===============

UICR.PERIPHCONF points to an array of key-value pairs used to initialize specific global peripherals before the application starts.
This mechanism allows for the one-time configuration of peripherals managed by |ISE| and is not designed for general system initialization.

Each entry in the array consists of two 32-bit values.
The fields in each value are described in the following tables.

Value 0:

+-------------------+----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Bit number(s)     | 31-2                             | 1-0                     |
+-------------------+----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Field             | REGPTR                           | UNUSED                  |
+-------------------+----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Description       | Bits [31:2] of a pointer to a    | Unused.                 |
|                   | peripheral register.             |                         |
+-------------------+----------------------------------+-------------------------+

Value 1:

+-------------------+----------------------------------+
| Bit number(s)     | 31-0                             |
+-------------------+----------------------------------+
| Field             | VALUE                            |
+-------------------+----------------------------------+
| Description       | Register value.                  |
+-------------------+----------------------------------+

|ISE| processes the PERIPHCONF array sequentially, starting from the address specified by UICR.PERIPHCONF.ADDRESS.
Processing continues until either the number of entries defined by UICR.PERIPHCONF.MAXCOUNT has been processed, or an entry is encountered with the REGPTR field set to 0x3FFF_FFFF (all ones), which indicates the end of the array.

|ISE| uses an allow list to determine which register addresses the REGPTR field is permitted to reference.
Each register address in the allow list has an associated bit mask that specifies which bits from the VALUE field are applied to the target register.

Given an entry in the PERIPHCONF array and a bit mask M, |ISE| performs the following write operation::

   *(REGPTR << 2) = (VALUE & M) | (*(REGPTR << 2) & ~M)

The register allow list and corresponding bit masks are documented with each |ISE| release.

Each entry in the PERIPHCONF array is validated during processing.
To pass validation, (REGPTR << 2) must point to a register address included in the allow list.

After applying the entry, |ISE| performs a read-back check: it reads back the register value, applies the bit mask, and compares the result against the masked VALUE field.

The configuration procedure is aborted if an entry fails either the validation or the read-back check.
If a failure occurs, BOOTSTATUS.BOOTERROR is set to indicate the error condition, and a description of the failed entry is written to the boot report.

Peripheral configuration using nrf-regtool
------------------------------------------

The ``nrf-regtool`` utility generates a UICR.PERIPHCONF configuration from the devicetree.
To determine which peripherals are in use, it analyzes the devicetree as follows:

#. Enumerate all peripheral nodes and include only those with a ``status`` property set to ``okay``.
#. Parse peripheral-specific attributes (for example, the ``owned-channels`` property in DPPIC nodes).
#. Collect GPIO pin assignments from all pin references (for example, ``pinctrl`` entries).

It then generates the appropriate configuration values by reusing existing properties.

See the following table for a mapping between the devicetree input used by ``nrf-regtool`` and the resulting output in the automatically migrated :file:`periconf_migrated.c` file.

.. _ug_nrf54h20_ironside_se_programming:

Programming
***********

For programming instructions, see :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_SoC_binaries`.

By default, the nRF54H20 SoC uses the following memory and access configurations:

* *MRAMC configuration*: MRAM operates in *Direct Write mode*.
* *MPC configuration*: All memory not reserved by Nordic firmware is accessible with read, write, and execute (RWX) permissions by any domain.
* *TAMPC configuration*: The Access Port (AP) for the application core is enabled and available, allowing direct programming of all the memory not reserved by Nordic firmware in the default configuration.

.. note::
   Access to external memory (EXMIF) requires a non-default configuration of the GPIO.CTRLSEL register.

Global domain memory can be protected from write operations by configuring UICR registers.
To remove these protections and disable all other protection mechanisms enforced through UICR settings, perform an ``ERASEALL`` operation.

.. _ug_nrf54h20_ironside_se_debug:

Debugging
*********

|ISE| provides the ``DEBUGWAIT`` boot command to halt the application core immediately after reset.
This ensures that a debugger can attach and take control from the very first instruction.

When ``DEBUGWAIT`` is enabled, |ISE| sets the application domain's CPUWAIT when the application core starts.
This prevents the CPU from executing any instructions until a debugger manually releases it.

.. note::
   You can also use the ``cpuconf`` service to set CPUWAIT when booting other cores.

.. _ug_nrf54h20_ironside_se_protecting:

Protecting the device
*********************

To protect the nRF54H20 SoC in a production-ready device, you must enable the following UICR-based security mechanisms:

* UICR.APPROTECT - Disables all debug and AP access.
  It restricts debugger and access-port (AP) permissions, preventing unauthorized read/write access to memory and debug interfaces.
* UICR.LOCK - Freezes non-volatile configuration registers.
  It locks the UICR, ensuring that no further UICR writes are possible without issuing an `ERASEALL` command.
* UICR.PROTECTEDMEM - Enforces integrity checks on critical code and data.
  It defines a trailing region of application-owned MRAM whose contents are integrity-checked at each boot, extending the root of trust to your immutable bootloader or critical data.
* UICR.MPCCONF - Configures memory protection for the bootloader region.
  It should be used to set RX-only (read and execute) permissions on the PROTECTEDMEM region containing the bootloader, preventing unauthorized modification while allowing execution.
* UICR.ERASEPROTECT - Prevent bulk erasure of protected memory.
  It blocks all `ERASEALL` operations on NVR0, preserving UICR settings even if an attacker attempts a full-chip erase.


IronSide boot report
********************

The IronSide boot report contains device state information communicated from |ISE| to the local domains.
It is written to a reserved region in RAM20, which is accessible to the local domain in the default system configuration.
There is one boot report per processor that is booted, either directly by |ISE| or via the CPUCONF service.

The boot report contains the following information:

* Magic value
* |ISE| version
* |ISE| recovery version
* |ISE| update status
* UICR error description
* Context data passed to the CPUCONF service
* A fixed amount of random bytes generated by a CSPRNG

Versions
========

The boot report includes version information for both |ISE| and |ISE| Recovery.

The regular version format consists of four fields: ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.SEQNUM``, with each field occupying 8 bits.
The first three fields follow semantic versioning, while the ``SEQNUM`` field is a wrapping sequence number that increments by one with each version.
The values ``0`` and ``127`` are reserved for ``SEQNUM``.

An additional version field, referred to as the *extra version*, contains a null-terminated ASCII string with human-readable version information.
This string is informational only, and no semantics should be attached to this part of the version.

|ISE| update status
===================

The |ISE| boot ROM code (SDROM) reports the status of an |ISE| update request through SICR.UROT.UPDATE.STATUS.
The value of this register is copied to the |ISE| update status field of the boot report.

UICR error description
======================

This field indicates if any UICR error occurred.

Local domain context
====================

This field is populated by the local domain that is invoking the CPUCONF service.
It is set to `0` for the application core which is booted by |ISE|.
This service is used when one local domain boots another local domain.
The caller can populate this field with arbitrary data that will be made available to the local domain being booted.
Typical examples of data that could be passed include IPC buffer sizes or the application firmware version.
The unused parts of this field are set to 0.

Random data
===========

This field is filled with random data generated by a CSPRNG.
This data is suitable as a source of initial entropy.

************************

|ISE| boots the System Controller core first, followed by the application core, in that order.
When booting the application core, |ISE| does the following:

* Sets the application domain's INITSVTOR to the first 32-bit word of the application-owned memory.
* Reads the reset vector from the second 32-bit word of the application-owned memory.
* If the reset vector is set to 0xFFFFFFFF, sets CTRL_AP.BOOTSTATUS.BOOTERROR to indicate that no firmware is programmed.
* If any other error is encountered during initialization, sets CTRL_AP.BOOTSTATUS.BOOTERROR accordingly.
* If CTRL_AP.BOOTSTATUS.BOOTERROR is non-zero (meaning an invalid UICR configuration is detected), sets the application domain's CPUWAIT to 1; otherwise, sets it to 0.
* Sets the application domain's CPUSTART to 1.
* Stops the allocation procedure.
* Updates the boot report to indicate the UICR entry (and, if applicable, the array index) that triggered the failure.
* Sets CTRL_AP.BOOTSTATUS.BOOTERROR to indicate the source of the error.
* Starts the application core with application domain's CPUWAIT = 1 (halted mode).

This allows the error report to be read by a debugger, if the device is not protected.

.. _ug_nrf54h20_ironside_se_cpuconf_service:

|ISE| CPUCONF service
*********************

The |ISE| CPUCONF service enables the application core to trigger the boot of another CPU at a specified address.

Specifically, |ISE| sets INITSVTOR of the CPUCONF instance of the processor being booted with the address provided to the IronSide call, and then writes 0x1 to CPUSTART of the CPUCONF instance of the processor being booted to start the target CPU.
When CPUWAIT is enabled in the IronSide service call, the target CPU is stalled by writing 0x1 to CPUWAIT of the CPUCONF instance of the processor being booted.

This feature is intended for debugging purposes.

.. note::

   * TASKS_ERASECACHE of the CPUCONF instance of the processor being booted is not yet supported.
   * INITNSVTOR of the CPUCONF instance of the processor being booted will not be supported.

For details about the CPUCONF peripheral, refer to the nRF54H20 SoC datasheet.

.. _ug_nrf54h20_ironside_se_update_service:

|ISE| update service
********************

|ISE| is updated by the Secure Domain ROM (SDROM), which performs the update operation when triggered by a set of SICR registers.
SDROM verifies and copies the update candidate specified through these registers.

|ISE| exposes an update service that allows local domains to trigger the update process by indirectly writing to the relevant SICR registers.

The release ZIP archive for |ISE| includes the following components:

* A HEX file containing the update candidate for |ISE|.
* A HEX file for |ISE| Recovery.
* An application core image that executes the |ISE| update service to install the update candidate HEX files.

The |NCS| defines the west ``ncs-ironside-se-update`` command to update |ISE| on a device via the debugger.
This command takes a nRF54H20 SoC binary ZIP file and uses the |ISE| update service to update both the |ISE| and |ISE| Recovery (or optionally just one of them).
For more information, see :ref:`abi_compatibility`.

+------------------+--------+------------------+-----+----------------+--------+------------+

.. _ug_nrf54h20_ironside_se_bootstatus_register_format:

CTRLAP.BOOTSTATUS register format
*********************************

The general format of the CTRLAP.BOOTSTATUS register is described in the following table.

+------------------+-------+-----------+------+
| Bit numbers      | 31-28 | 27-24     | 23-0 |
+------------------+-------+-----------+------+
| Field            | RFU   | BOOTSTAGE | INFO |
+------------------+-------+-----------+------+

Fields marked as RFU (Reserved for Future Use) are set to 0, unless otherwise specified.
The BOOTSTAGE field indicates which component in the boot sequence encountered a failure.

If ``BOOTSTAGE`` is set to ``0xC`` or ``0xD``, the register has the following format:

+------------------+-------+-----------+-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----+-------------+
| Bit numbers      | 31-28 | 27-24     | 23-22 | 21-15     | 14-12     | 11-9      | 8   | 7-0         |

+------------------+-------+-----------+-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----+-------------+

This field can have one of the following values:

+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| BOOTSTAGE value    | Description                                                  |

+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0xD                | Secure domain recovery firmware (major version >= 20)        |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

.. note::
   The value ``0xB`` indicates a boot status error reported by the Secure Domain running a version earlier than version 20.

The register is written by |ISE| at the end of every cold boot sequence.
A value of 0 indicates that |ISE| did not complete the boot process.

The following fields are reported by |ISE|:

FWVERSION
  Reports the SEQNUM field of the |ISE| version.
  The value reported in this field is incremented with each released version of the firmware.
  It can be used to distinguish between firmware versions within a specific release window.

CMDOPCODE
  The opcode of the boot command issued to |ISE| in the CTRLAP.MAILBOX.BOOTMODE register.
  A value of 0 indicates that no boot command has been issued.

CMDERROR
  A code indicating the execution status of the boot command specified in CMDOPCODE:

  * A status value of 0 indicates that the command was executed successfully.
  * A non-zero value indicates that an error condition occurred during execution of the command.
    The error code 0x7 means that an unexpected condition happened that might have prevented the command from executing.
    Other error codes must be interpreted based on the boot command in CMDOPCODE.

BOOTERROR
  A code indicating the status of the application domain boot sequence:

  * A status value of 0 indicates that the CPU was started normally.
  * A non-zero value indicates that an error condition occurred, preventing the CPU from starting.
    Detailed information about the issue can be found in the boot report.

.. _ug_nrf54h20_ironside_se_boot_commands:

Boot commands
*************

The debugger can instruct |ISE| to perform an action during the boot sequence.
These actions are called *boot commands*.

Boot commands are issued through the CTRLAP.MAILBOX.BOOTMODE register and are processed only during a cold boot.
|ISE| indicates that a boot command was executed by setting the CTRLAP.BOOTSTATUS register.

The recommended flow for issuing a boot command if the following:

1. Write the command opcode to the OPCODE field in CTRLAP.MAILBOX.BOOTMODE.
#. Trigger a global reset by setting CTRLAP.RESET = 1.

   .. note::
      Any global reset that does not involve a power cycle can be used in place of a CTRLAP reset here.

#. Wait for the command status to be acknowledged in CTRLAP.BOOTSTATUS.
#. Clear the command opcode by writing zeroes to the OPCODE field in CTRLAP.MAILBOX.BOOTMODE.
   As this register is retained across resets, it must be cleared to prevent the command from being re-executed on the next cold boot.

See the following table for a summary of the available boot commands:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Opcode
     - Command name
     - Description
   * - ``ERASEALL``
     - ``0x1``
     - Erase all user data.
   * - ``DEBUGWAIT``
     - ``0x2``
     - Start the application CPU with ``CPUCONF.CPUWAIT = 1``.

The following chapters describe each command in detail.

``ERASEALL`` commmand
=====================

The ``ERASEALL`` command instructs |ISE| to erase all application-owned memory.
When executed, the ``ERASEALL`` command performs the following operations:

#. Erases all pages in MRAM10, from the first page immediately after the |ISE| Recovery Firmware through the last page in the region.
#. Clears all global domain general-purpose RAM by writing zeros.
#. Erases page 0 of the MRAM10 NVR (excluding the BICR), which also clears the UICR.
#. Erases all non-NVR pages in MRAM11.

.. note::
  Page 1 of the MRAM10 NVR is preserved and not erased.

To explicitly permit the ``ERASEALL`` command, disable erase protection by clearing the UICR.ERASEPROTECT field in the application's UICR.

Erase protection prevents unauthorized device repurposing.
In production-ready devices, enabling both access-port protection (UICR.APPROTECT) and erase protection (UICR.ERASEPROTECT) prevents the device from re-entering the *configuration* state using a debugger.

.. note::
   When an ``ERASEALL`` request is blocked by UICR.ERASEPROTECT, CTRLAP.BOOTSTATUS.CMDERROR is set to ``0x1``.

``DEBUGWAIT`` command
=====================

The ``DEBUGWAIT`` command instructs |ISE| to start the application core in a halted state by setting ``CPUCONF.CPUWAIT = 1``.
This prevents the CPU from executing any instructions until the CPUWAIT register is cleared by a connected debugger.

Use this command to begin debugging at the very first instruction or to program flash memory safely without concurrent CPU access.

The ``DEBUGWAIT`` command does not define any command-specific values for the CTRLAP.BOOTSTATUS.CMDERROR field.
