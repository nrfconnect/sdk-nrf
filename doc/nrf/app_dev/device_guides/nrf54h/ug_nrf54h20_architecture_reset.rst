All local domain resets trigger a reset of the entire SoC.

nRF Util allows for different types of reset behavior on the various cores of the nRF54H20 SoC, based on the current lifecycle state of the device.

Reset types in LCS EMPTY
------------------------

The following is the reset behavior when the LCS of the nRF54H20 SoC is in the ``EMPTY`` state:

.. list-table:: Reset behavior based on LCS ``EMPTY``
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Reset kind in LCS ``EMPTY``
     - Reset behavior
   * - ``RESET_SYSTEM``
     - Mapped to the ``SYS_RESET_REQUEST`` bit as described in the ARM specification for the *Application Interrupt and Register Controller*.
       This reset triggers a reset of the Secure Domain, which subsequently resets the entire system.
       It is available only to the Secure Domain.
   * - ``RESET_HARD``
     - Initiates a reset using the CTRL-AP through the On-Board Debugger (OBD).
       The register used is ``RESET`` (address offset: ``0x00``).
   * - ``RESET_PIN``
     - J-Link toggles the **RESET** pin using OBD.
   * - ``RESET_VIA_SECDOM``
     - Not supported.
   * - ``RESET_DEFAULT``
     - Selects ``RESET_HARD``.

Reset types in LCS ROT or DEPLOYED
-----------------------------------

The following is the reset behavior when the LCS of the nRF54H20 SoC is either in the ``ROT`` or ``DEPLOYED`` state:

.. list-table:: Reset behavior based on LCS ``ROT`` or ``DEPLOYED``
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Reset kind in LCS ``ROT`` or ``DEPLOYED``
     - Reset behavior
   * - ``RESET_SYSTEM``
     - Not supported.
   * - ``RESET_HARD``
     - Initiates a reset using the CTRL-AP through the On-Board Debugger (OBD).
       The register used is **RESET** (address offset: ``0x00``).
   * - ``RESET_PIN``
     - J-Link toggles the **RESET** pin using OBD.
   * - ``RESET_VIA_SECDOM``
     - Uses the CTRL-AP mailbox to send a local domain reset request to the IronSide Secure Element (IronSide SE).

       This command resets the entire system while keeping both the application core and the radio core in a halted state.

       You can start each core individually using the following commands:

       * To start the Application core: ``nrfutil device go --core Application``
       * To start the Network core: ``nrfutil device go --core Network``

       This approach is particularly useful for debugging individual domains, starting from their reset handlers.

   * - ``RESET_DEFAULT``
     - Selects ``RESET_HARD``.

Reset your device using nRF Util
================================

To trigger a specific reset type on your nRF54H20 SoC-based device, use the ``nrfutil device reset`` command::

   nrfutil device reset --serial-number <serial_number> --reset-kind <reset_kind>

For a detailed list of commands for each reset type, run the following::

   nrfutil device reset --help

For more information on ``nrfutil device reset``, see `nRF Util documentation pages <Device command overview_>`_.
