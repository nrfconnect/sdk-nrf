Lifecycle states control device security features and debug access.
Each state specifies when and how the device allows the following operations:

* Provision or replace security assets, for example, root keys, certificates, and configuration
* Enable or disable debug access (open, authenticated, or permanently disabled)
* Enforce secure boot and prevent rollback
* Perform failure analysis (RMA) handling
* Sanitize the device before disposal

Available LCS
*************

The Secure Domain ROM implements these lifecycle states for the nRF54H20 SoC.
The states are based on the Arm PSA Security Model and enable safe programming and erasure of device assets.

The LCS available are the following:

   nRF54H20 lifecycle states and transitions available on the nRF54H20 SoC.

Transitioning LCS
*****************

You can change the SoC lifecycle state to streamline development and testing:

* During application development, set the SoC to the ``Root of Trust`` (RoT) state.
* To validate behavior in a production environment, use the ``DEPLOYED`` state.

If the device is in LCS ``EMPTY``, transition it to LCS ``RoT`` by following the :ref:`nRF54H20 DK bring-up <ug_nrf54h20_gs_bringup>` procedure.

.. caution::
   You can only progress forward through lifecycle states.
   As such, the transition from ``EMPTY`` to ``RoT`` is permanent and cannot be reversed.
   Each forward transition increases protection and reduces invasive debug options.
