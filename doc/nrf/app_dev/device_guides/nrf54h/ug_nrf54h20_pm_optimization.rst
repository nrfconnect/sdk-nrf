Overview
********

This section introduces the core principles of power management on the nRF54H20 SoC.


Optimal power state selection
=============================

In the nRF54H20 SoC, each local domain is responsible for selecting the power state that results in minimal power consumption while maintaining an acceptable level of performance.

Entering a deeper sleep state leads to power savings when the system is idle, but entering and exiting the sleep state increases the power consumption.
There is a minimum sleep duration that justifies the energy spent on entering and exiting a sleep state, and this duration varies for each sleep state.

In the SoC, a local domain has full control over entering and exiting local sleep states, allowing it to assess whether entering these sleep states is optimal at any given moment.
However, entering sleep states associated with system-off requires cooperation between local domains and the System Controller.
Local domains have limited control over the time and energy required to enter or exit system-off, as well as the power consumption during system-off.

Latency management
==================

The sources of wake-up latency in the nRF54H20 SoC can be categorized into local and global types.
Each CPU is responsible for managing its latency sources, with local sources handled by local domains and global sources managed by the System Controller.

Local cores are responsible for handling latencies caused by restoring the system from suspend-to-RAM states.
They schedule their wake-up before expected events.
The timing of expected events is reported to the power management subsystem in the RTOS by the software modules anticipating these events.
The power management subsystem sets a ``GRTC`` channel in advance of the next expected event to compensate for local wake-up latency.

The System Controller is responsible for handling latencies caused by restoring the system from the system-off state (the warm boot procedure latency).
It schedules the system wake-up from the system-off state in advance of the next ``GRTC`` event to compensate for the warm-boot latency of the system.

Because the warm-boot latency is compensated by the System Controller, from a local CPU's perspective, the latency when restoring from the local-off state and the system-off state is expected to be the same.

Latency in local domains
------------------------

Any local software module (such as a device driver) can anticipate events like ISRs.
Some of these events have predictable timing, while others have unpredictable timing.
Handling the latency of events with unpredictable timing is the same in both simple and complex systems.

If handling an event with predictable timing requires restoring the state of the software module or the peripherals used by this module before the event is processed, the software module is responsible for scheduling a timer event in advance.
This scheduled event is used to restore the state of the software module or peripherals.

The power management subsystem in a local domain is responsible for scheduling a wake-up in advance to compensate for the domain's core state restoration latency from the local power state.
The wake-up time scheduled in advance by the power management subsystem is combined with the advance time added by the software module.
This approach ensures that the local domain and the software modules anticipating an event have sufficient time to fully restore before the event occurs, allowing the event to be handled without latency.

Optimization example
********************

This example focuses on a HID device use case (for example, a mouse).

A mouse has typically two main application states:

* Active, when the user is moving the mouse.
* Idle, triggered after an inactivity timeout until an input from the user is detected.

The following is an example workflow for the *Active* application state:

1. Sample input data from sensors.
#. Construct a HID report.
#. Transmit the report over the radio.
#. Sleep until the next period (usually, less than 1 ms).

Power consumption targets
=========================

The power consumption targets of this sample for sleep currents (5V supply) are the following:

+---------------------------------------------+----------------------------+
| Component                                   | Sleep current (5V supply)  |
+=============================================+============================+
| Application core (Suspend-to-RAM)           | < 10 µA                    |
+---------------------------------------------+----------------------------+
| Radio core (Suspend-to-Idle, cache disabled)| < 10 µA                    |
+---------------------------------------------+----------------------------+

The power consumption targets of this sample for active currents (estimates at 5V) are the following:

+--------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| Activity                                   | Active current (mA)  |
+============================================+======================+
| Radio core in idle                         | ~0.25                |
+--------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| App core in idle                           | ~0.15                |
+--------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| Core wake-up every 1 ms                    | +0.05                |
+--------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| ADC sample every 1 ms                      | +0.10                |
+--------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| SPI transaction every 1 ms                 | +0.20                |
+--------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| IPC message every 1 ms                     | +0.15                |
+--------------------------------------------+----------------------+

.. note::
   The SPI current can be reduced to 0.03 mA by using the nrfy API instead of the default Zephyr blocking driver.

Recommended Kconfig configuration
=================================

For the application running on the application core, setting the following Kconfig options is recommended:

  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM` to ``y``
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_S2RAM` to ``y``
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_POWEROFF` to ``y``
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_S2RAM_CUSTOM_MARKING` to ``y``
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_DEVICE` to ``y``
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME` to ``y``

For the application running on the radio core, setting the following Kconfig options is recommended:

  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM` to ``y``
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_POWEROFF` to ``y``
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_DEVICE` to ``y``
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME` to ``y``

Consider also the following recommendations:

  * Disable all unused peripherals before entering sleep (Zephyr's API does this automatically when supported).
  * Add ``zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto`` in the DTS for all peripherals with runtime PM support.
  * Build and program an empty image on any unused core to release shared resources.

Memory and cache optimization recommendations
=============================================

The following recommendations help optimize memory placement and cache usage to minimize power consumption:

* Relocate frequently accessed code and data to local RAM to avoid waking global domains, especially MRAM, which uses high power.
  For more information, see the :ref:`zephyr:code_data_relocation` page.
* Profile L1 cache usage to minimize MRAM accesses.
  For more information, see ``nrf_cache_hal`` in the `nrfx API documentation`_.
* Ensure the MRAM latency manager is disabled:

  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MRAM_LATENCY` set to ``n`` (default) allows MRAM to power off when idle.
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MRAM_LATENCY_AUTO_REQ` disabled prevents automatic MRAM-on requests.

Peripheral and clock recommendations
====================================

The following guidelines help optimize peripheral and clock usage to minimize power consumption:

* Use global peripherals from the slow domain (peripheral index 13X) to avoid waking up the fast global domain, which uses more power.
* If radio is frequently active, keep HFXO enabled (wake-up ≈ 800 µs).
* For SPI, consider using nrfy or nrfx libraries instead of Zephyr's blocking driver to save ~170 µA.
  Using nrfy has the following advantages:

  * Non-blocking transfers without mandatory callbacks, reducing wake-ups.
  * Reuse of a constant TX buffer when sending the same data, avoiding repeated updates.

DVFS on application core
------------------------

The application core supports Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), offering three distinct frequency options.
While the lowest or middle frequencies typically provide the best power efficiency, it is recommended to test each setting to determine the optimal choice for your specific use case.

Reduction of wake-ups
---------------------

Waking up the radio core at a 1-ms interval consumes approximately 50 µA of average current.
To minimize power consumption, design your application to avoid frequent wake-ups by synchronizing events, such as sensor sampling, or by using the PPI to trigger tasks without CPU intervention.

Single- vs dual-core considerations
===================================

When choosing between single-core and dual-core architectures (using either the application core, the radio core, or both), consider the following trade-offs:

* A single-core solution (radio core only) can reduce IPC overhead (~0.15 mA at 1 kHz).
* The larger local RAM on the radio core (compared to the application core) allows more code to run off the MRAM.
* Always load an empty image on the unused core to free global resources allocated to this core by the System Controller on initialization.
  You can refer to ``benchmarks.multicore.idle.nrf54h20dk_cpuapp_cpurad.s2ram`` contained in the :file:`sdk-nrf/tests/benchmarks/multicore/idle/testcase.yaml` test file.
  To create an empty image, use the following code:

  .. code-block:: c

      int main()
      {
        return 0;
      }

Deep-sleep policy
=================

Some peripherals do not schedule an expected wake-up, which can cause Zephyr's power manager to enter and almost immediately exit a deep sleep state.
This consumes a lot of energy and incurs overhead from pre-sleep checks.
This issue often occurs when the system is awakened by an external source, such as an IPC signal from another core, where it is not possible to properly schedule an expected wake-up event.
Additionally, whenever the application attempts to enter a sleep state, the Zephyr subsystem performs numerous operations to determine whether to transition the SoC into a low-power mode.

The minimum sleep durations that justify entering a deep sleep state are the following:

* Suspend-to-Idle: ≥ 1 ms
* Suspend-to-RAM: ≥ 2 ms

To prevent the system from entering deep sleep prematurely, use policy locks.
By acquiring a policy lock, you can disable deep-sleep states when the application is expected to run again in a short period (for example, at a 1 kHz rate).
This can save up to 0.5 mA.

.. code-block:: c

   /* In active mode: lock deep states */
   pm_policy_state_lock_get(PM_STATE_SUSPEND_TO_IDLE, PM_ALL_SUBSTATES);
   pm_policy_state_lock_get(PM_STATE_SUSPEND_TO_RAM,   PM_ALL_SUBSTATES);

   /* Before going to sleep: unlock */
   pm_policy_state_lock_put(PM_STATE_SUSPEND_TO_IDLE, PM_ALL_SUBSTATES);
   pm_policy_state_lock_put(PM_STATE_SUSPEND_TO_RAM,   PM_ALL_SUBSTATES);

Additional considerations
=========================

When implementing these recommendations, consider also the following:

* When using a custom radio protocol, apply the HMPAN-216 workaround, enabling the 0.8V rail 40 µs before every radio RX and TX operation.

  .. note::
     This workaround is already implemented for Bluetooth LE and Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB).

* Test with the latest nRF54H20 SoC bundle to benefit from all the latest fixes and improvements.
