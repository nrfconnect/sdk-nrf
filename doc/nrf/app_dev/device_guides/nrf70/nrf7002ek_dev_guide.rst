The nRF7002 :term:`Evaluation Kit (EK)` (PCA63556), part of the `nRF70 Series Family <nRF70 Series product page_>`_, is an Arduino shield that features the nRF7002 companion IC.
The kit is designed to provide Wi-FiÂ® connectivity and Wi-Fi (SSID) scanning capabilities through the nRF7002 companion IC to a compatible host development board.
In addition, the shield may be used to emulate the nRF7001 and nRF7000 companion IC variants.

   nRF7002 EK

The nRF7002 EK features an Arduino shield form factor and interface connector that allows it to be used with Arduino compatible boards, such as the `nRF52840 DK <nRF52840 DK product page_>`_, `nRF5340 DK <nRF5340 DK product page_>`_, `nRF9151 DK <Nordic nRF9151 DK_>`_, `nRF9161 DK <Nordic nRF9161 DK_>`_, or `nRF9160 DK <nRF9160 DK product page_>`_.
This interface is used to connect the nRF7002 companion device to a host :term:`System on Chip (SoC)`, Microprocessor Unit (MPU), or :term:`Microcontroller Unit (MCU)`.
For the pin assignment of the interface connectors, see the `nRF7002 companion IC`_ page in the kit's `Hardware User Guide <nRF7002 EK User Guide_>`_.

.. note::
   ``UART1`` cannot be used and must be disabled on the nRF9160 DK, as ``UART1`` ``RXD`` and ``TXD`` conflict with pins **P0.00** and **P0.01** (Arduino pins **D0** and **D1**).
   These correspond to the IOVDD-CTRL-GPIOS and BUCKEN-GPIOS signals in the nRF7002 EK, respectively.

   For an nRF7002 EK connected to an nRF9160 DK, you can find example overlays at the following paths:

   * :file:`sdk-nrf/boards/shields/nrf7002ek/boards/nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns.overlay`
   * :file:`sdk-nrf/samples/cellular/lwm2m_client/boards/nrf9160dk_with_nrf7002ek.overlay`

Building and programming with nRF7002 EK
****************************************

To build for the nRF7002 EK, build for the compatible :ref:`board target <app_boards_names>` with the CMake ``SHIELD`` option set to ``nrf7002ek``.

To add support for the nRF7002 EK on an application running on a compatible host development board, build for the compatible :ref:`board target <app_boards_names>` and specify the ``SHIELD`` CMake option:

* To add support for the nRF7002 EK and the nRF7002 IC, set ``SHIELD`` to ``nrf7002ek``.
* To emulate support for the nRF7001 or nRF7000 ICs, set ``SHIELD`` to ``nrf7002ek_nrf7001`` or ``nrf7002ek_nrf7000``, respectively.

See :ref:`cmake_options` for instructions on how to provide CMake options.

For example, if you build for nRF5340 DK on the command line, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DSHIELD=nrf7002ek

If you use the |nRFVSC|, specify ``-DSHIELD=nrf7002ek`` in the **Extra Cmake arguments** field when `setting up a build configuration <How to work with build configurations_>`_.

Alternatively, add the shield in the project's :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file, specifying the below settings, depending on which IC is to be used:

.. code-block:: console

   set(SHIELD nrf7002ek)

.. code-block:: console

   set(SHIELD nrf7002ek_nrf7001)

.. code-block:: console

   set(SHIELD nrf7002ek_nrf7000)
