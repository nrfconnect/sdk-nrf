Connecting with Edge Impulse Studio
***********************************

The Nordic Thingy:53 is preprogrammed with Edge Impulse firmware.
The Edge Impulse firmware enables data collection from all the sensors on the Nordic Thingy:53.
You can use the collected data to train and test machine learning models.
Deploy the trained machine learning model to the Nordic Thingy:53 over BluetoothÂ® LE or USB.

Complete the following steps to get started with Edge Impulse:

1. Go to the `Edge Impulse`_ website.
#. Create a free Edge Impulse account.
#. Download the `nRF Edge Impulse mobile app`_.
#. Follow the instructions in the `Nordic Semi Thingy:53 page`_.

Precompiled Thingy:53 firmware
******************************

If you want to program your Nordic Thingy:53 with other precompiled firmware, you can download the latest precompiled firmware from the following sources:

* The `Nordic Thingy:53 Downloads`_ page (the Precompiled application firmware section).
  The package contains a :file:`CONTENTS.txt` file listing the locations and names of different firmware images.
* The `nRF Programmer`_ mobile application (available for Android and iOS).
  The application lists the available precompiled firmware images when you open it.

Updating precompiled firmware
=============================

You can update the precompiled firmware using any of the following methods:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: nRF Programmer (Bluetooth LE)

      You can update the Nordic Thingy:53 application and network core over Bluetooth LE using the nRF Programmer mobile application for Android or iOS.

      Complete these steps to update the firmware:

      1. Open the nRF Programmer app.

         A list of available samples appears.

         .. figure:: ./images/thingy53_sample_list.png
            :alt: nRF Programmer - list of samples

            nRF Programmer - list of samples

      #. Select a sample.

         Application info appears.

         .. figure:: ./images/thingy53_application_info.png
             :alt: nRF Programmer - Application Info

             nRF Programmer - Application Info

      #. Select the version of the sample from the drop-down menu.
      #. Tap :guilabel:`Download`.

         When the download is complete, the name of the button changes to :guilabel:`Install`.
      #. Tap :guilabel:`Install`.

         A list of nearby devices and their signal strengths appears.
      #. Select your Nordic Thingy:53 from the list.
         It is listed as **El Thingy:53**.

         The transfer of the firmware image starts, and a progress wheel appears.

         .. figure:: ./images/thingy53_progress_wheel.png
             :alt: nRF Programmer - progress wheel

         If you want to pause the update process, tap :guilabel:`Pause`.
         If you want to stop the update process, tap :guilabel:`Stop`.

         The image transfer is complete when the progress wheel reaches 100%.
         The Nordic Thingy:53 is reset and updated to the new firmware sample.
      #. Tap :guilabel:`Done` to return to Application info.
