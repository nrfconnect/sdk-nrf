The Nordic Thingy:53 is a battery-operated prototyping platform for IoT Systems.
The Nordic Thingy:53 integrates the nRF5340 SoC that supports BluetoothÂ® Low Energy, IEEE 802.15.4 based protocols and Near Field Communication (NFC).
The nRF5340 is augmented with the nRF21540 RF FEM (Front-end Module) Range extender that has an integrated power amplifier (PA)/low-noise amplifier (LNA) and nPM1100 Power Management IC (PMIC) that has an integrated dual-mode buck regulator and battery charger.
