Developing with coprocessors

.. caution::

   The High-Performance Framework (HPF) support in the |NCS| is :ref:`experimental <software_maturity>` and is limited to the nRF54L15 device.

You can use the VPR coprocessor (Fast Lightweight Peripheral Processor - FLPR) as follows:

* As an additional core in a multicore system using Zephyr in multithreaded mode (see the :ref:`nRF54L15<vpr_flpr_nrf54l>` and :ref:`nRF54H20 devices<ug_nrf54h20_flpr>` pages).
* As a peripheral emulator, using one of the following methods depending on the use case:

  * :ref:`High-Performance Framework (HPF)<hpf_index>`
  * :ref:`nrfxlib:soft_peripherals`

  .. note::

   In these usage modes, it is important to clearly differentiate between the Soft Peripheral and HPF solutions.
   Soft Peripherals serve as a direct replacement for hardware peripherals, offering guaranteed performance.
   In contrast, the HPF will allow you to accelerate protocol operations, but performance depends on your implementation.
   We recommend using the Soft Peripheral solution if it meets your product's requirements.

The following table outlines the main differences between the usage modes.
For detailed comparison see the :ref:`ug_hpf_softperipherals_comparison` page.
