MCUboot's serial recovery of the networking core image

In addition to the recovery of the application core image, also the networking core image can be recovered.
When you build MCUboot for the nRF5340 DK or the Thingy:53, you can use this feature with one of the following options:

* :ref:`ug_nrf5340_multi_image_dfu`
* Serial recovery for the network core in the one image pair mode, where sysbuild Kconfig option ``SB_CONFIG_MCUBOOT_UPDATEABLE_IMAGES`` is set to ``== 1``.

To enable the serial recovery of the network core while the multi-image update is not enabled in MCUboot, set the following Kconfig options in the MCUboot image:

* select :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOT_IMAGE_ACCESS_HOOK`
* select :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FLASH_SIMULATOR`
* select :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FLASH_SIMULATOR_DOUBLE_WRITES`
* disable :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FLASH_SIMULATOR_STATS`
* select :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_SERIAL_DIRECT_IMAGE_UPLOAD`
* select :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF53_RECOVERY_NETWORK_CORE`

Additionally, define and include the following memory partitions:

* ``mcuboot_primary`` and ``mcuboot_secondary`` - Partitions for the application core image slots.
* ``mcuboot_primary_1`` - Partition for the network core image slot.
* ``pcd_sram`` - Partition used for command exchange between the application core and the network core (see :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PCD_APP`).

.. note::
   When using MCUboot with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF53_RECOVERY_NETWORK_CORE` option enabled, the application core does not have direct access to the network core flash memory.
   Due to this, ``mcuboot_primary_1`` must be used as the RAM partition mediator.

To upload the networking image, use the following command::

     ./mcumgr image upload <build_dir_path>/signed_by_mcuboot_and_b0_<app_name>.bin -e -n 3 -c serial_conn

Where ``<app_name>`` is the name of the network core image and ``serial_conn`` is the serial connection configuration.
See :ref:`MCUmgr image management <dfu_tools_mcumgr_cli_image_mgmt>` for more information.

Container for firmware update binaries
**************************************

The build system will automatically place both the application core and the network core update binaries into a container package named :file:`dfu_application.zip`.
This container package can be used by update tools to pass both images during the simultaneous update of multiple images.
