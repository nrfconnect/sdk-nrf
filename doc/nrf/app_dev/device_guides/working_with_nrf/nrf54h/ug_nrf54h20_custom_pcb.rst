This guide demonstrates how to create your custom board files for your PCB for the nRF54H20 SoC.

Prepare your PCB
****************

First, you need to create your PCB for the nRF54H20 SoC.

We highly recommend using the PCB layouts and component values provided by Nordic Semiconductor, especially for clock and power sources, considering the following limitations:

* The DC/DC inductor must be present on the PCB, and the ``inductor-present;`` node must be configured either in the :file:`zephyr/boards/your_board/nrf54h20dk_bicr.dtsi` file or in the section where ``bicr: bicr@fff87b0`` is present in the devicetree.
* For the lowest sleep power consumption, use a 32 KHz crystal.
* The **P9** port cannot be used with internal or external pull-down resistors.
* For optimal performance, the output impedance of the **P6** and **P7** ports should match the PCB and external device pin impedance.
* Use one of the following power supply options:

  * VDDH higher than 2.05V.
  * VDDH shorted to VDD at 1.8V

Prepare the configuration files for your custom board in the |NCS|
******************************************************************

The nRF54H20 DK uses multiple board files for its configuration.
You can use these files as a starting point for configuring your own custom board.
When creating a :ref:`Zephyr repository application <zephyr:zephyr-repo-app>`, copy the files from :file:`sdk-zephyr/boards/nordic/nrf54h20dk` to the :file:`sdk-zephyr/boards/<your_vendor_prefix>/<your_custom_board_name>` file.

You must edit the :file:`.dts` and :file:`.overlay` files for your project to match your board configuration, similarly to any new board added to the |NCS| or Zephyr.

See the following documentation pages for more information:

* The :ref:`zephyr:devicetree` documentation to familiarize yourself with the devicetree language and syntax.
* The :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_configuration` page for more information on how to configure your DTS files for the nRF54H20 SoC.
* The :ref:`zephyr:zephyr-repo-app` page for more information on Zephyr application types.
* The :ref:`dm_adding_code` documentation for details on the best user workflows to add your own code to the |NCS|.

.. note::
   The configuration of board files is based on the nRF54H20 common SoC files located in :file:`sdk-zephyr/dts/common/nordic/`.
   Each new |NCS| revision might change these files, breaking the compatibility with your custom board files created for previous revisions.
   Ensure the compatibility of your custom board files when migrating to a new |NCS| release.

   See :ref:`zephyr:board_porting_guide` for more information.

Configure, generate, and flash BICR
***********************************

The Board Information Configuration Registers (BICR) are non-volatile memory (NVM) registers that contain information on how the nRF54H20 SoC must interact with other board elements, including the information about the power and clock delivery to the SoC.
The power and clock control firmware uses this information to apply the proper regulator and oscillator configurations.

.. caution::
   You must ensure that the configuration is correct.
   An incorrect configuration can damage your device.

BICR allows for the configuration of various components on your custom board, like the following:

* Power rails
* Low-frequency oscillator
* High-frequency oscillator (HFXO)
* GPIO ports power and drive control
* Tamper switches
* Active shield channels

You can find the details in the DTS specification for the BICR in :file:`sdk-zephyr/dts/bindings/misc/nordic,nrf-bicr.yaml`

When not set, the registers' default value is ``0xFFFFFFFF``.

The ``LFOSC.LFXOCAL`` register is used by the device to store the calibration of the LFXO.

When ``LFOSC.LFXOCAL`` is ``0xFFFFFFFF`` at device boot, the firmware recalibrates the LFXO oscillator and writes the calibration data to the ``LFOSC.LFXOCAL`` register.
This is useful when making a change on the PCB (for example, when changing the crystal).
This initial calibration is only performed once.
Each subsequent start will use this initial calibration as the starting point.

BICR configuration
==================

The nRF54H20 DK BICR configuration can be found in the board configuration directory as :file:`sdk-zephyr/boards/nordic/nrf54h20dk/nrf54h20dk_bicr.dtsi`.
This file is used by the |NCS| build system to generate a corresponding HEX file.
You can start from this file when editing the values of the devicetree properties inside your custom board folder (:file:`boards/nordic/your_custom_board`), according to your board configuration.

.. caution::
   A mismatch between the board and the configuration values in BICR can damage the device or set it in an unrecoverable state.

Generating the BICR binary
==========================

To generate the BICR binary, you must first set the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_REGTOOL_GENERATE_BICR` to ``y``.
When running ``west build``, the build system then creates the relevant HEX file (:file:`bicr.hex`) at build time.
Based on the peripheral definition extracted from the nRF54H20 SVD file, the modified registers from the configuration are mapped into their relevant position in memory.

.. note::
   If the build system cannot locate the ``bicr`` node inside your custom board's devicetree, or if you did not create a custom :file:`.dtsi` file for it, the BICR generation cannot progress, and the build system will skip it.

You can find the generated :file:`bicr.hex` file in the :file:`build_dir/zephyr/`.
The presence of a ``bicr`` node in the application devicetree will automatically trigger a build of the BICR binary, and will place this file alongside the other binary outputs such as ``zephyr.hex`` and ``uicr.hex``.

Flashing the BICR binary
========================

After the |NCS| build system generates the BICR binary, you must flash this binary manually.
The content of BICR should be loaded to the SoC only once and should not be erased nor modified unless the PCB layout changes.
To manually program the generated :file:`bicr.hex` file to the SoC, use nRF Util as follows::

    nrfutil device program --options chip_erase_mode=ERASE_NONE --firmware bicr.hex --core Application --serial-number <serial_number>

You only need to follow this programming process once, assuming the PCB configuration applied through the BICR is correct the first time.
However, it is also possible to reprogram the BICR while in the LCS ``RoT``.
This can be useful, for example, when adjusting the configuration as the PCB design gets refined or modified, requiring the process to be repeated.

Validate the BICR binary
------------------------

After programming the BICR binary onto the device, validate whether the BICR works with your device as follows:

1. Reset the device::

      nrfutil device reset --reset-kind RESET_PIN --serial-number <serial_number>

2. When in LCS ``EMPTY``, use ``nrfutil`` to validate the BICR status by reading the memory::

      nrfutil device x-read --address 0x2F88FF1C --serial-number 1051164514 --core Secure

   nrfutil returns the BICR loading status using one of the following values:

   * ``0x289CFB73``: BICR applied without error.
     This indicates that the power configuration of the BICR is valid and you can proceed to the next step.
   * ``0xD78213DF``: BICR application was skipped.
     This indicates that no BICR was programmed to the device.
     Revisit the previous step to ensure the programming command was executed, and that the BICR was correctly generated.
   * ``0xCE68C97C``: BICR application failed.
     This indicates that there is an issue with the BICR, but in most cases this can be recovered by programming the correct BICR for your board.
   * ``Error``: This indicates that the device is likely suffering from severe power issues after applying the BICR.
     This state is likely unrecoverable.

Program the SDFW and SCFW
*************************

After programming the BICR, the nRF54H20 SoC requires the provisioning of a bundle ( :file:`nrf54h20_soc_binaries_v0.6.5.zip`) containing the precompiled firmware for the Secure Domain and System Controller.
To program the nRF54H20 SoC binaries to the nRF54H20 DK, do the following:

1. Download the `nRF54H20 SoC binaries v0.6.5`_.
#. Move the :file:`ZIP` bundle to a folder of your choice.
#. |open_terminal_window_with_environment|
#. Run nRF Util to program the binaries using the following command::

      nrfutil device x-provision-nrf54h --firmware <path-to_bundle_zip_file> --serial-number <serial_number>

You can run the following command to confirm that the Secure Domain Firmware has loaded correctly:

   nrfutil device x-adac-lcs-change

If issues occur during bundle programming, the system will return an ``ADAC_FAILURE`` error.

Verify the LCS and transition to RoT
************************************

To successfully run your custom application on your custom board, the SoC must have its Lifecycle State (LCS) set to ``RoT`` (meaning Root of Trust).
If the LCS is set to ``EMPTY``, you must transition it to ``RoT``.

.. note::
   The forward transition to LCS ``RoT`` is permanent.
   After the transition, it is not possible to transition backward to LCS ``EMPTY``.

To transition the LCS to ``RoT``, do the following:

1. |open_terminal_window_with_environment|
#. Verify the current lifecycle state of the nRF54H20::

      nrfutil device x-adac-discovery --serial-number <serial_number>

   The output will look similar to the following::

      *serial_number*
      adac_auth_version     1.0
      vendor_id             Nordic VLSI ASA
      soc_class             0x00005420
      soc_id                [e6, 6f, 21, b6, dc, be, 11, ee, e5, 03, 6f, fe, 4d, 7b, 2e, 07]
      hw_permissions_fixed  [00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00]
      hw_permissions_mask   [01, 00, 00, 00, 87, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00]
      psa_lifecycle         LIFECYCLE_EMPTY (0x1000)
      sda_id                0x01
      secrom_revision       0xad3b3cd0
      sysrom_revision       0xebc8f190
      token_formats         [TokenAdac]
      cert_formats          [CertAdac]
      cryptosystems         [Ed25519Sha512]
      Additional TLVs:
      TargetIdentity: [ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff]

#. If the lifecycle state (``psa_lifecycle``) shown is ``RoT`` (``LIFECYCLE_ROT (0x2000)``), no LCS transition is required.
   If the lifecycle state (``psa_lifecycle``) shown is not ``RoT`` (``LIFECYCLE_EMPTY (0x1000)`` means the LCS is set to ``EMPTY``), set it to Root of Trust using the following command::

      nrfutil device x-adac-lcs-change --life-cycle rot --serial-number <serial_number>

#. Verify again the current lifecycle state of the nRF54H20::

      nrfutil device x-adac-discovery --serial-number <serial_number>

   The output will look similar to the following::

      *serial_number*
      adac_auth_version     1.0
      vendor_id             Nordic VLSI ASA
      soc_class             0x00005420
      soc_id                [e6, 6f, 21, b6, dc, be, 11, ee, e5, 03, 6f, fe, 4d, 7b, 2e, 07]
      hw_permissions_fixed  [00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00]
      hw_permissions_mask   [01, 00, 00, 00, 87, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00]
      psa_lifecycle         LIFECYCLE_ROT (0x2000)
      sda_id                0x01
      secrom_revision       0xad3b3cd0
      sysrom_revision       0xebc8f190
      token_formats         [TokenAdac]
      cert_formats          [CertAdac]
      cryptosystems         [Ed25519Sha512]
      Additional TLVs:
      TargetIdentity: [ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff]

   The lifecycle state (``psa_lifecycle``) is now correctly set to *Root of Trust* (``LIFECYCLE_ROT (0x2000)``)

#. After the LCS transition, reset the device::

      nrfutil device reset --reset-kind RESET_PIN --serial-number <serial_number>

Create or modify your application for your custom board
*******************************************************

You can now create or modify your application for your custom board.
When doing so, consider the following:

* When reusing the |NCS| applications and samples, you must provide board-specific overlay files when such files are needed.
  For general information on configuration overlays, see :ref:`configure_application`.

  However, you must consider the following nRF54H20-specific difference:

  * The application might require board overlays for multiple cores.
    In this case, ensure that these overlays are consistent with each other.

* When creating a new application specific to your new board, DTS board files can contain all necessary configurations, and no overlay file is needed.
  However, the same limitations regarding the consistency and UICR configuration apply, but should be kept on the board files level.

* You must manually program the BICR if it has been modified.

Update the SDFW and SCFW
************************

When a new version of the nRF54H20 firmware bundle is released, you can update it as follows:

1. Download the new version of the nRF54H20 firmware bundle (:file:`nrf54h20_soc_binaries_v<x.y.z>.zip`).
#. Move the :file:`ZIP` bundle to a folder of your choice and unzip it.
#. |open_terminal_window_with_environment|
#. Verify the current version of the nRF54H20 SoC binaries by running the following command::

      nrfutil device x-sdfw-version-get --firmware-slot uslot --serial-number <serial_number>

   If the nRF54H20 SoC binaries version is 0.5.0 or higher, continue to the next step.
#. Run nRF Util to update the binaries using the following SUIT command::

      nrfutil device x-suit-dfu --serial-number <snr> --firmware nordic_top.suit

#. Run again the following command to verify the new SDFW version::

      nrfutil device x-sdfw-version-get --firmware-slot uslot --serial-number <serial_number>
