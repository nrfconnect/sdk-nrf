.. _ug_nrf54h20_gs_bringup:

nRF54H20 DK bring-up
********************

The following sections describe the steps required for the nRF54H20 bring-up.

.. rst-class:: numbered-step

Programming the BICR
====================

The Board Information Configuration Registers (BICR) are non-volatile memory (NVM) registers that contain information on how the nRF54H20 SoC must interact with other board elements, including the information about the power and clock delivery to the SoC.
To prepare the nRF54H20 DK for first use, you must manually program the values of the BICR using a precompiled BICR binary file (:file:`bicr.hex`).

1. Download the `BICR new binary file`_.
#. Connect the nRF54H20 DK to your computer using the **DEBUGGER** port on the DK.

.. note::
   On MacOS, connecting the DK might cause a popup containing the message ``â€œDisk Not Ejected Properly`` to repeatedly appear on screen.
   To disable this, run ``JLinkExe``, then run ``MSDDisable`` in the J-Link Commander interface.

#. List all the connected development kits to see their serial number (matching the one on the DK's sticker)::

      nrfutil device list

#. Move the BICR HEX file to a folder of your choice, then program the BICR by running nRF Util from that folder using the following command::

      nrfutil device program --options chip_erase_mode=ERASE_NONE --firmware build/zephyr/bicr.hex --core Application --serial-number <serialnumber>

.. rst-class:: numbered-step

.. _ug_nrf54h20_SoC_binaries:

Programming the nRF54H20 SoC binaries
=====================================

After programming the BICR, the nRF54H20 SoC requires the provisioning of the nRF54H20 SoC binaries, a bundle ( :file:`nrf54h20_soc_binaries_v0.6.5.zip`) containing the precompiled firmware for the Secure Domain and System Controller.
To program the nRF54H20 SoC binaries to the nRF54H20 DK, do the following:

1. Download the `nRF54H20 SoC binaries v0.6.5`_.

   .. note::
      On MacOS, ensure that the ZIP file is not unpacked automatically upon download.

#. Move the :file:`.zip` bundle to a folder of your choice, then run nRF Util to program the binaries using the following command::

      nrfutil device x-provision-nrf54h --firmware <path-to_bundle_zip_file> --serial-number <serial_number>

.. rst-class:: numbered-step

Transitioning the nRF54H20 SoC to RoT
=====================================

The current nRF54H20 DK is delivered with its lifecycle state (LCS) set to ``EMPTY``.
To correctly operate, its lifecycle state must be transitioned to Root of Trust (``RoT``).

.. note::
   The forward transition to LCS ``RoT`` is permanent.
   After the transition, it is not possible to transition backward to LCS ``EMPTY``.

To transition the LCS to ``RoT``, do the following:

1. Verify the current lifecycle state of the nRF54H20::

      nrfutil device x-adac-discovery --serial-number <serial_number>

   The output will look similar to the following::

      *serial_number*
      adac_auth_version     1.0
      vendor_id             Nordic VLSI ASA
      soc_class             0x00005420
      soc_id                [e6, 6f, 21, b6, dc, be, 11, ee, e5, 03, 6f, fe, 4d, 7b, 2e, 07]
      hw_permissions_fixed  [00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00]
      hw_permissions_mask   [01, 00, 00, 00, 87, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00]
      psa_lifecycle         LIFECYCLE_EMPTY (0x1000)
      sda_id                0x01
      secrom_revision       0xad3b3cd0
      sysrom_revision       0xebc8f190
      token_formats         [TokenAdac]
      cert_formats          [CertAdac]
      cryptosystems         [Ed25519Sha512]
      Additional TLVs:
      TargetIdentity: [ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff]

#. If the lifecycle state (``psa_lifecycle``) shown is ``RoT`` (``LIFECYCLE_ROT (0x2000)``), no LCS transition is required.
   If the lifecycle state (``psa_lifecycle``) shown is not ``RoT`` (``LIFECYCLE_EMPTY (0x1000)`` means the LCS is set to ``EMPTY``), set it to Root of Trust using the following command::

      nrfutil device x-adac-lcs-change --life-cycle rot --serial-number <serial_number>

#. Verify again the current lifecycle state of the nRF54H20::

      nrfutil device x-adac-discovery --serial-number <serial_number>

   The output will look similar to the following::

      *serial_number*
      adac_auth_version     1.0
      vendor_id             Nordic VLSI ASA
      soc_class             0x00005420
      soc_id                [e6, 6f, 21, b6, dc, be, 11, ee, e5, 03, 6f, fe, 4d, 7b, 2e, 07]
      hw_permissions_fixed  [00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00]
      hw_permissions_mask   [01, 00, 00, 00, 87, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00]
      psa_lifecycle         LIFECYCLE_ROT (0x2000)
      sda_id                0x01
      secrom_revision       0xad3b3cd0
      sysrom_revision       0xebc8f190
      token_formats         [TokenAdac]
      cert_formats          [CertAdac]
      cryptosystems         [Ed25519Sha512]
      Additional TLVs:
      TargetIdentity: [ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff]

   The lifecycle state (``psa_lifecycle``) is now correctly set to *Root of Trust* (``LIFECYCLE_ROT (0x2000)``)

#. After the LCS transition, reset the device::

      nrfutil device reset --reset-kind RESET_PIN --serial-number <serial_number>

.. _ug_nrf54h20_gs_sample:

Building and programming the sample
***********************************

The :zephyr:code-sample:`sysbuild_hello_world` sample is a multicore sample running on both the application core (``cpuapp``) and the Peripheral Processor (PPR, ``cpuppr``).
It uses the ``nrf54h20dk/nrf54h20/cpuapp`` board target.

To build and program the sample to the nRF54H20 DK, complete the following steps:

1. Connect the nRF54H20 DK to your computer using the **DEBUGGER** port on the DK.
#. Open nRF Connect for Desktop, navigate to the Toolchain Manager, select the v2.7.99-cs2 toolchain, and click the :guilabel:`Open terminal` button.
#. In the terminal window, navigate to the :file:`zephyr/samples/sysbuild/hello_world` folder containing the sample.
#. Build the sample for application and radio cores by running the following command::

      west build -p -b nrf54h20dk/nrf54h20/cpuapp -T sample.sysbuild.hello_world.nrf54h20dk_cpuapp_cpurad .

You can now program the sample.
If you have multiple Nordic Semiconductor devices, make sure that only the nRF54H20 DK you want to program is connected.

.. code-block:: console

   west flash

The sample will be automatically built and programmed on both the application core and the Peripheral Processor (PPR) of the nRF54H20.

.. include:: /includes/nRF54H20_erase_UICR.txt

.. _ug_nrf54h20_sample_reading_logs:

Reading the logs
****************

With the :zephyr:code-sample:`sysbuild_hello_world` sample programmed, the nRF54H20 DK outputs logs for the application core and the configured remote processor.
The logs are output over UART.

To read the logs from the :zephyr:code-sample:`sysbuild_hello_world` sample programmed to the nRF54H20 DK, complete the following steps:

1. Connect to the DK with a terminal emulator (for example, `nRF Connect Serial Terminal`_) using the :ref:`default serial port connection settings <test_and_optimize>`.
#. Press the **Reset** button on the PCB to reset the DK.
#. Observe the console output for the application core:

   .. code-block:: console

      *** Booting nRF Connect SDK zephyr-v3.5.0-3517-g9458a1aaf744 ***
      Hello world from nrf54h20dk/nrf54h20/cpuapp

.. note::
   If no output is shown when using nRF Serial Terminal, select a different serial port in the terminal application.
