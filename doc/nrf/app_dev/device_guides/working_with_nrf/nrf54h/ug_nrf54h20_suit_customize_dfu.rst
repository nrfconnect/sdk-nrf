Nordic Semiconductor provides a Software Update Internet of Things (SUIT) sample (:ref:`ug_nrf54h20_suit_intro`) which uses predefined configurations in the build system.
The specified Kconfig options in the sample can be used to customize the DFU process and integrate the DFU solution with external build systems.
This guide provides a comprehensive set of instructions for modifying values in the :ref:`SUIT manifest <ug_nrf54h20_suit_manifest_overview>`.

Overview of the SUIT DFU procedure
**********************************

The SUIT DFU protocol is essential for secure, reliable firmware updates in IoT devices, particularly for the nRF54H20 SoC.
It consists of two main concepts: the SUIT envelope and the SUIT manifest.

* The SUIT envelope acts as a secure container for transporting firmware updates, encapsulating the firmware binary and its manifest.
* The SUIT manifest is a structured file with metadata essential for the update process, including firmware version, size, and hash for integrity verification.

Default manifest templates are provided by Nordic Semiconductor and used by default during application build.
These templates are suitable for simple cases and form the basis for generating SUIT envelopes and manifests tailored to specific application requirements.
Customization of these templates is crucial for specific use cases and security requirements.

For detailed guidance on customizing these templates and creating your own templates, refer to the :ref:`ug_suit_use_own_manifest` section.

.. _ug_suit_build_system_config:

Build system configuration
**************************

By default the build system generates SUIT envelopes using predefined manifest templates provided by Nordic Semiconductor.
These templates can be found in :file:`modules/lib/suit-generator/ncs`, and are suitable for standard development needs.

Three manifests are used in the most common case:

* Root manifest - :file:`root_with_binary_nordic_top.yaml.jinja2`
* Application domain manifest - :file:`app_envelope.yaml.jinja2`
* Radio domain manifest - :file:`rad_envelope.yaml.jinja2`

.. note::
   The radio domain manifest template is available only for the BluetoothÂ® Low Energy version of the :ref:`nrf54h_suit_sample`, not the UART version.

The process of building a SUIT envelope (which contains the manifests) can be summarized with the following diagram:

.. figure:: images/nrf54h20_suit_generator_workflow.png
   :alt: Modifying manifest templates workflow

   Modifying manifest templates workflow

Manifest templates (``.jinja2``) files are rendered to YAML files.
These YAML files are used as a representation of the output binary SUIT envelopes.
The provided manifest templates (``.jinja2``) files contain variables (represented as components), such as memory ranges, names, and paths to binaries.
The component values are filled out automatically by the build system during the manifest rendering.

Variables in the provided templates, like memory ranges and paths to binaries, are filled out by the build system.

.. _ug_suit_use_own_manifest:

How to use your own manifest
----------------------------

When creating an application, it is recommended to create a custom set of manifest templates and use the templates provided by Nordic Semiconductor only as a starting point.
Using Nordic Semiconductor templates directly in a product is strongly discouraged.

The build system searches for the manifest templates in the following order:

#. It checks if :kconfig:option:`SB_CONFIG_SUIT_ENVELOPE_ROOT_TEMPLATE_FILENAME` or :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SUIT_ENVELOPE_TEMPLATE_FILENAME` exists in the :file:`<sample-dir>/suit/${SB_CONFIG_SOC}/` file.

#. It checks if :kconfig:option:`SB_CONFIG_SUIT_ENVELOPE_ROOT_TEMPLATE_FILENAME` or :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SUIT_ENVELOPE_TEMPLATE_FILENAME` exists in the :file:`<sdk-nrf-dir>/config/suit/templates/${SB_CONFIG_SOC}/${SB_CONFIG_SUIT_BASE_MANIFEST_VARIANT}/` file.

The build system selects the set of files from the first successful step.

Creating custom manifest templates
==================================

You can create custom manifest templates in the application directory using the following command:

.. code-block::

   west suit-manifest init --soc nrf54h20

This command will copy the default set of SUIT manifest templates into the :file:`suit/nrf54h20` subdirectory.
You can edit those manifest templates to your needs and add them into your version control system along with the generated :file:`metadata.yaml` file.

By default, the command uses the manifest templates from the ``default`` variant.
Manifest template variants serve different use cases, as described in the following table.

+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Variant name | Description                                                            | Bootable components               | Updateable components             |
+==============+========================================================================+===================================+===================================+
| ``default``  | This set of manifest templates integrates all payloads into the SUIT   | * One application domain firmware | * One application domain firmware |
|              | envelope and has a high requirement on the DFU partition size.         |                                   |                                   |
|              |                                                                        | * One radio domain firmware       | * One radio domain firmware       |
|              | Use this variant if your application does not use the external flash   |                                   |                                   |
|              | and is small enough to fit into the executable MRAM partitions and     |                                   | * nordic_top (optional)           |
|              | into the DFU partition.                                                |                                   |                                   |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

You can initialize the manifest templates from a different variant using the following command:

.. code-block::

   west suit-manifest init --soc nrf54h20 --variant default/latest

This command will copy the set of SUIT manifests from the latest version of the selected variant into the :file:`suit/nrf54h20` subdirectory.
You can replace ``latest`` with a specific version, such as ``v1``.

Reviewing changes between nRF Connect SDK releases
==================================================

The content of the Nordic Semiconductor SUIT templates may change between the |NCS| releases, for example to fix bugs or security issues.

After updating to a newer |NCS| release, you can view what changes occurred in the Nordic Semiconductor templates that your custom templates were derived from and the Nordic Semiconductor templates that are present in the new |NCS| release.
To do so, use the following command:

.. code-block::

   west suit-manifest review --soc nrf54h20

The command displays a diff where you can review the changes.
If you see a change that is relevant to your application, you can apply them manually to your custom manifest templates.

After reviewing the changes, you can update the :file:`metadata.yaml` to point to the new Nordic Semiconductor templates.

.. code-block::

   west suit-manifest review --soc nrf54h20 --accept

Make sure to check-in the changes into your version control system.

Metadata file
=============

The :file:`metadata.yaml` file contains information about the Nordic Semiconductor manifest templates from which the custom manifest templates were derived.
The file should be added into the version control system alongside the custom manifest templates.

The ``west suit-manifest review`` command uses the metadata to display the changes between the lastly linked Nordic Semiconductor manitest templates and the manifest templates that are present in the |NCS| release that is currently being used.

The ``west suit-manifest review --accept`` command updates the metadata to link with the Nordic Semiconductor manifest templates that are present in the |NCS| release that is currently being used.


Things to avoid
===============

Some samples use the :kconfig:option:`SB_CONFIG_SUIT_BASE_MANIFEST_VARIANT` Kconfig option.
This option exists only for the convenience of the |NCS| developers and it must not be used in user applications.
When you create your own custom manifest templates, remove this option.

.. _ug_suit_customize_uuids:

Customize Vendor and Class UUIDs
--------------------------------

Customizing UUIDs used for class and vendor IDs enhances security and is recommended for specific use cases.
Values for ``class-identifier`` and ``vendor-identifier`` in the manifest are created based on the ``CONFIG_SUIT_MPI_<MANIFEST_ROLE>_VENDOR_NAME`` and ``CONFIG_SUIT_MPI_<MANIFEST_ROLE>_CLASS_NAME`` Kconfig options.
Specifically, in the basic case:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SUIT_MPI_ROOT_VENDOR_NAME`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SUIT_MPI_ROOT_CLASS_NAME`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SUIT_MPI_APP_LOCAL_1_VENDOR_NAME`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SUIT_MPI_APP_LOCAL_1_CLASS_NAME`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SUIT_MPI_RAD_LOCAL_1_VENDOR_NAME`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SUIT_MPI_RAD_LOCAL_1_CLASS_NAME`

These Kconfigs are used during Manifest Provisioning Information (MPI) generation.
After the MPI has been flashed, it is read by the Secure Domain Firmware, which can then use it to verify if the UUIDs in a manifest are correct,

As as an example, after adding the following lines to the :file:`prj.conf` file:

.. code-block::

   CONFIG_SUIT_MPI_APP_LOCAL_1_VENDOR_NAME="ACME Corp"
   CONFIG_SUIT_MPI_APP_LOCAL_1_CLASS_NAME="Light bulb"

You will find the following lines in the generated manifest .yaml file :file:`build/DFU/application.yaml`

.. code-block::

  - suit-directive-override-parameters:
      suit-parameter-vendor-identifier:
         RFC4122_UUID: ACME Corp              # Changed vendor-identifier value
      suit-parameter-class-identifier:
         RFC4122_UUID:                        # Changed class-identifier values
           namespace: ACME Corp
           name: Light bulb

.. _ug_suit_var_methods_in_manifest:

Variables and methods available in the manifest templates
**********************************************************

The manifest templates have access to the following:

* Devicetree values (`edtlib`_ object)
* Target names
* Paths to binary artifacts
* Application version

Some of these values are stored in the Python dictionaries that are named after the target name.
(Therefore, Python is used within the ``.jinja2`` files to fill in the necessary values in the manifest(s).)
For example, for the :ref:`nrf54h_suit_sample` there will be two variables available: ``application`` and ``radio``.
The target names (the names of these variables) can be changed using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SUIT_ENVELOPE_TARGET` Kconfig option for a given image.
Each variable is a Python dictionary type (``dict``) containing the following keys:

* ``name`` - Name of the target
* ``dt`` -  Devicetree representation (`edtlib`_ object)
* ``binary`` - Path to the binary, which holds the firmware for the target

Additionally, the Python dictionary holds all the variables defined inside the :file:`VERSION` file, used for :ref:`zephyr:app-version-details` in Zephyr and the |NCS|.
The default templates searches for the following options inside the :file:`VERSION` file:

* ``APP_ROOT_SEQ_NUM`` - Sets the application root manifest sequence number.
* ``APP_ROOT_VERSION`` - Sets the application root manifest current (semantic) version.
* ``APP_LOCAL_1_SEQ_NUM`` - Sets the application local manifest sequence number.
* ``APP_LOCAL_1_VERSION`` - Sets the application local manifest current (semantic) version.
* ``RAD_LOCAL_1_SEQ_NUM`` - Sets the radio local manifest sequence number.
* ``RAD_LOCAL_1_VERSION`` - Sets the radio local manifest current (semantic) version.
* ``APP_RECOVERY_SEQ_NUM`` - Sets the application recovery manifest sequence number.
* ``APP_RECOVERY_VERSION`` - Sets the application recovery manifest current (semantic) version.
* ``RAD_RECOVERY_SEQ_NUM`` - Sets the radio recovery manifest sequence number.
* ``RAD_RECOVERY_VERSION`` - Sets the radio recovery manifest current (semantic) version.

With the Python dictionary you are able to, for example:

* Extract the CPU ID by using ``application['dt'].label2node['cpu'].unit_addr``
* Obtain the partition address with ``application['dt'].chosen_nodes['zephyr,code-partition']``
* Obtain the size of partition with ``application['dt'].chosen_nodes['zephyr,code-partition'].regs[0].size``
* Get the pair of URI name and the binary path by using ``'#{{ application['name'] }}': {{ application['binary'] }}``
* Get the root manifest sequence number with ``suit-manifest-sequence-number: {{ APP_ROOT_SEQ_NUM }}``

Additionally, the **get_absolute_address** method is available to recalculate the absolute address of the partition.
With these variables and methods, you can define templates which will next be filled out by the build system and use them to prepare the output binary SUIT envelope.
The examples below demonstrate the use of these variables and methods.

.. _ug_suit_suit_set_comp_def_mem_range:

Set component definition and memory ranges
------------------------------------------

In :file:`modules/lib/suit-generator/ncs/app_envelope.yaml.jinja2`
, the component definition and memory ranges are filled out by using the ``edtlib`` (devicetree values) object like so:

.. code-block::

    suit-components:
    - - MEM
    - ``{{ application['dt'].label2node['cpu'].unit_addr }}``
    - ``{{ get_absolute_address(application['dt'].chosen_nodes['zephyr,code-partition']) }}``
    - ``{{ application['dt'].chosen_nodes['zephyr,code-partition'].regs[0].size }}``

.. note::
   See the :ref:`ug_suit_dfu_component_def` page for a full list and table of the available customizable components.

Set integrated payload
----------------------

In :file:`modules/lib/suit-generator/ncs/app_envelope.yaml.jinja2`
, the integrated payload definition is done using the target name and binary location:

.. code-block::

    suit-integrated-payloads:
    ``'#{{ application['name'] }}': {{ application['binary'] }}``

.. _ug_suit_root_manifest_temp:

Root manifest template
----------------------

The file :file:`modules/lib/suit-generator/ncs/root_with_binary_nordic_top.yaml.jinja2` contains content that is dynamically created, depending on how many targets are built.
The following example only shows a selected portion of the root manifest file.
For more information, see the file available in the sample and `Jinja documentation`_:

.. code-block::

   {%- set component_index = 0 %}                                                  # Initialize the `component_index variable`.
                                                                                   # This variable will be used to assign component indexes dynamically depending on
                                                                                   # How many cores have been built.

                                                                                   # This variable will be used to execute `suit-directive-set-component-index` over
                                                                                   # all components, except the first one with index 0.

.. _ug_suit_using_manifest_gen:

How to use the manifest generator
**********************************

The **suit-generator** tool is used by the build system to create and parse SUIT envelopes.
This Python-powered tool can be used as a command-line application, a Python module, or a script.

To use **suit_generator** from the command line:

.. code-block::

   pip install <workspace>/modules/lib/suit-generator
   suit-generator --help
   suit-generator create --input-file input.yaml --output-file envelope.suit
   suit-generator parse --input-file envelope.suit

As a Python module:

.. code-block:: python

   from suit_generator import envelope
   envelope = SuitEnvelope()
   envelope.load('input.yaml')
   envelope.dump('output.suit')

Executing the Python script from the command line:

.. code-block::

   python <workspace>/modules/lib/suit-generator/cli.py create --input-file input.yaml --output-file envelope.suit

.. _ug_suit_edit_build_artifacts:

Edit build artifacts
--------------------

The :ref:`nrf54h_suit_sample` :file:`/build/DFU` directory contains several artifacts related to the SUIT process:

* :file:`./build/DFU/radio.yaml`
* :file:`./build/DFU/application.yaml`
* :file:`./build/DFU/root.yaml`
* :file:`./build/DFU/radio.suit`
* :file:`./build/DFU/application.suit`
* :file:`./build/DFU/root.suit`

These files can be used with the **suit-generator** for various purposes, such as recreating SUIT files, restoring YAML files from a binary SUIT envelope, debugging a SUIT envelope, and converting between different SUIT-related file types.

.. note::
    You must build the sample at least once to make these artifacts available.

Recreate SUIT files
-------------------

To recreate SUIT files:

.. code-block::

   suit-generator create --input-file ./build/DFU/root.yaml --output-file my_new_root.suit

Restore YAML files from a binary SUIT envelope
----------------------------------------------

To restore a YAML file from a binary SUIT envelope:

.. code-block::

   suit-generator parse --input-file ./build/DFU/root.suit --output-file my_new_root.yaml

Debug a SUIT envelope
---------------------

To debug a SUIT envelope, by printing their parsed content to the ``stdout``, run the following:

.. code-block::

   suit-generator parse --input-file ./build/DFU/root.suit

.. note::
   The previous command can be extended by parsing the dependent manifests by calling:

   .. code-block::

      suit-generator parse --input-file ./build/DFU/root.suit --parse-hierarchy

Convert between file types
--------------------------

All mentioned artifacts can be converted back-and-forth, remembering that calculated and resolved YAML entries like UUIDs or files will be presented as a RAW value in the form of HEX strings.

For example, if you have an input entry like the following:

.. code-block::

   suit-parameter-class-identifier:
      RFC4122_UUID:
         namespace: nordicsemi.com
         name: nRF54H20_sample_app

This entry will be presented, after parsing, as the following:

.. code-block::

   suit-parameter-class-identifier:
      raw: 08c1b59955e85fbc9e767bc29ce1b04d
