To read logs on the nRF54H20 DK, you can use the following methods:

* A direct UART connection to a specific core.
* Local domain logging with System Trace Macrocell (STM).
  STM has two modes:

  * Standalone logging
  * Assisted multicore logging

For general information on how logging works in the |NCS|, consult the :ref:`ug_logging` and :ref:`zephyr:logging_api` documentation pages.

nRF54H20 logging using a direct UART connection
***********************************************

Similarly to other SoCs from Nordic Semiconductor, to use a UART connection for reading logs, follow the :ref:`ug_logging_backends_uart` logging guide in the application development section.

nRF54H20 logging using System Trace Macrocell (STM)
***************************************************

nRF54H20 domains contain ARM Coresight System Trace Macrocell (STM) hardware devices for collecting trace data from multiple domains, using either standalone logging or assisted multicore logging.
The STM uses memory-mapped registers to write trace data generated by the domains in the system.
It multiplexes the data as trace protocol data, formatted according to the MIPI System Trace Protocol (STP) v2, and synchronizes the data on a single output, such as a single UART.
This approach has a minimal cost on performance and code size, allowing for a non-intrusive collection of system debug-and-trace information.

The STM implements a frontend of the Zephyr logging subsystem, allowing you to use the standard Zephyr logging API.
For more information on STM, see :ref:`zephyr:logging_cs_stm`.

Embedded Trace Router (ETR)
===========================

The Embedded Trace Router (ETR) is a hardware feature that provides a circular buffer in RAM for trace data.
For more information on ETR, see :ref:`zephyr:logging_cs_stm`.

When using ETR on the nRF54H20 SoC, one of the cores is designated as a *proxy* to manage the trace data.

.. note::
   Currently, the Application core is the only core that can be designated as proxy.

The proxy core is responsible for handling the data from the ETR and outputting it through the desired transport mechanism (like UART or USB).
The proxy core approach allows for on-chip data processing, offering more flexibility than the Trace Port Interface Unit (TPIU).
However, due to the limited size of the ETR buffer, there is a risk of data loss if not handled promptly.

Standalone logging
==================

The standalone logging mode with STM on the nRF54H20 SoC works as follows:

1. All domains write the raw encoded log data to their own STM peripheral called the STM Extended Stimulus Port (STMESP).
#. The STMESP generates a data stream based on the register writes.
#. The STM multiplexes the data stream with streams from other domains, and it places them in the single memory buffer provided by the ETR.
#. The application core, acting as the ETR-designated proxy, reads the buffer and decodes the raw encoded log data.
#. The SDFW outputs the logging data in a human-readable format over UART.

Standalone logging leverages the frontend API of the Zephyr logging subsystem to select the stimulus ports and writes log messages directly to memory-mapped registers.
This method bypasses the need for string formatting functions and peripheral drivers, as the core writes directly to the STM port.

Configuring logging
-------------------

To show the logs for a given domain in the UART output, you must enable the STM for both the application core (as the ETR buffer processing proxy) and that domain's CPU.
To do so, use the :ref:`zephyr:nordic-log-stm` snippet when building the application for the related cores:
For example, the following command uses the snippet when building for the application core::

   west build -b nrf54h20dk/nrf54h20/cpuapp -S nordic-log-stm

All cores must use the same logging configuration.

Reading the logs
----------------

To read the STM log output on the UART, consult the following documentation pages:

* If you want to use the *nRF Serial Terminal* from the |nRFVSC|, see the `nRF Terminal documentation`_ on the `nRF Connect for Visual Studio Code`_ documentation site.
* If you want to use PuTTY, see :ref:`putty`.

.. note::
   To use UART in your application, the UART's node must be described in devicetree.
   For more details, see :ref:`zephyr:devicetree-intro`.

The following is an example log output::

   [00:00:00.154,790] <inf> app/spsc_pbuf: alloc in 0x2f0df800
   [00:00:00.163,319] <inf> app/spsc_pbuf: alloc 0x2f0df800 wr_idx:20
   [00:00:00.181,112] <inf> app/spsc_pbuf: commit in 0x2f0df800
   [00:00:00.189,090] <inf> app/spsc_pbuf: commit 0x2f0df800, len:20 wr_idx: 44

   [00:00:05.077,134] <inf> rad/spsc_pbuf: commit 0x2f0df000, len:20 wr_idx

Each log line contains a domain-related or core-related prefix between the log level and the module name, indicating the core that generated the log entry.
The following are the prefixes used to indicate the cores:

.. csv-table:: nRF54H20 log prefixes
   :header: "Core", "Prefix"

   Secure Domain, ``sec``
   Application core, ``app``
   Radio core, ``rad``
   System Controller (SysCtrl), ``sys``
   Fast Lightweight Processor (FLPR), ``flpr``
   Peripheral Processor (PPR), ``ppr``

Assisted multicore logging
==========================

Assisted multicore logging uses dictionary-based logging to send messages without redundant strings to STM, and is based on the :ref:`zephyr:logging_guide_dictionary` feature of the logging API provided by Zephyr.
For more information on assisted multicore logging, see :ref:`zephyr:logging_cs_stm`.

Configuring logging
-------------------

To show the logs for a given domain in the UART output, you must enable the STM for both the application core (as the ETR buffer processing proxy) and that domain's CPU.
To do so, use the :ref:`zephyr:nordic-log-stm-dict` snippet when building the application for the related cores.
For example, the following command uses the snippet when building for the application core::

   west build -b nrf54h20dk/nrf54h20/cpuapp -S nordic-log-stm-dict

All cores must use the same logging configuration.

After building your application, a dictionary database file named :file:`log_database.json` will be generated in the build directories for each one of the cores the snippet was used on (:file:`build/<app_name>/zephyr/`, where ``<app_name>`` is the name of the application built for each specific core).
This file is crucial for decoding the logs and is updated with every build.

Reading the logs
----------------

To read the dictionary-based STM log output, do the following:

1. Set up the log capture.

   Use the ``nrfutil trace stm`` command to start capturing logs from the device, specifying the database configuration for each domain ID, as well as the serial port, the baud rate, and the output type::

      nrfutil trace stm --database-config <domain_id>:build/<app_name>/zephyr/log_dictionary.json --input-serialport <port> --baudrate 115200 --stdout ascii

   This command contains the following parameters:

   * ``<domain_id>`` is the ID of the domain which the application is running on.
     It should be in decimals, not in hexadecimals.
     When using several domains, use a comma (`,`) to separate each domain in the list.
   * ``<app_name>`` is the application name.
   * ``<port>`` is the serial port used for output.
     Use ``nrfutil device list`` to list which serial ports are exposed by the development kit.
   * The output can be either the console (``--stdout ascii``) or a file (the :file:`out.txt` file if ``--output-ascii out.txt``).

#. Capture and decode the logs.

   nrfutil will capture the log data from the specified UART port and use the provided dictionary databases to decode the logs into a human-readable format.
   The decoded logs are sent to the previously-defined output (either the console or the :file:`out.txt` file in the previous example).

#. Read the terminal or open the output file to review the decoded log messages.

   The output contains timestamps and the log messages in a human-readable format.

If the log capture fails to find a sync, rerun the capture process.

.. note::
   Decoding artifacts or incorrect timestamps might occur when rerunning the process.

Each log line contains a domain-related or core-related prefix between the log level and the module name, indicating the core that generated the log entry.
The following are the prefixes used to indicate the cores:

.. csv-table:: nRF54H20 log prefixes
   :header: "Core", "Prefix", "ID"

   Secure Domain, ``sec``, 0x21
   Application core, ``app``, 0x22
   Radio core, ``rad``, 0x23
   System Controller (SysCtrl), ``sys``, 0x2c
   Fast Lightweight Processor (FLPR), ``flpr``, 0x2d
   Peripheral Processor (PPR), ``ppr``, 0x2e

For more information on ``nrfutil trace``, see `nrfutil-trace`_.

Additional considerations
-------------------------

When using assisted multicore logging, consider the following:

* Use optimized log macros (having up to 2 word size numeric arguments, like ``LOG_INF("%d %c", (int)x, (char)y)``) to improve the size and speed of logging.
* For memory constrained applications (for example, when running on the PPR or FLPR cores), disable the ``printk()`` function by setting both the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PRINTK` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOT_BANNER` Kconfig options to ``n`` in your project configuration.
* When working with multiple domains, such as the Secure Domain and Application core, ensure that each database is prefixed with the correct domain ID.
* Some log messages might be dropped due to the limited size of the RAM buffer that stores STM logs.
