The |NCS| provides several companion components.
Typically, a companion component is independent from the application and is included in your project as a separate firmware image.

Companion components are intended to be used as-is, but integrating them with your application can require minimal modifications of both the component and your application.
Refer to the component documentation for tested and supported integration instructions (see the links in the table).

While you can also significantly modify these components, they are only tested for the default configuration set provided in the |NCS|.

Depending on its function, a companion component image can either run on the same core as the application, as in the case of :ref:`bootloader` and :ref:`ug_tfm`, or run on a separate core, as in the case of :ref:`ipc_radio`.

You can add some of the components, such as :ref:`ipc_radio`, using :ref:`configuration_system_overview_sysbuild`.

The following table lists the available companion components:
