Essential MCUboot configuration items

The following page provides an overview of the key configuration items necessary for understanding and configuring MCUboot's behavior.
The :ref:`sysbuild` Kconfig options generally override the MCUboot's Kconfig option.
Sysbuild options aim to establish a coherent environment for the entire system, while MCUboot options focus specifically on the bootloader.
This means that many sysbuild options configure the MCUboot, the application, and the build system settings to ensure compatibility.

Supported image configurations
******************************

MCUboot primarily functions as a dual-bank bootloader, managing one bank as the executable and the other as an upgrade candidate or an alternative executable.
In MCUboot terminology, *image* refers to a specific type of executable code, typically the application image.
In the dual-bank scheme, two banks (or slots) are associated with each image.

MCUboot can be configured to support multiple images, enabling it to operate as an enhanced dual-bank bootloader.
This configuration allows for more complex update scenarios and greater flexibility in managing different sets of firmware:

* ``CONFIG_UPDATEABLE_IMAGE_NUMBER`` - Specifies the number of images that MCUboot can handle.
* :kconfig:option:`SB_CONFIG_MCUBOOT_UPDATEABLE_IMAGES` - Configures the number of images supported by MCUboot at the sysbuild level.

Operational modes of MCUboot
****************************

MCUboot supports various operational modes that dictate its behavior towards the application images it manages.
The choice of mode determines the specific scheme of the bootloader's operations for the images supported by a given MCUboot instance:

      - ``CONFIG_MCUBOOT_MODE_SINGLE_APP``
      - :kconfig:option:`SB_CONFIG_MCUBOOT_MODE_SINGLE_APP`
      - No

Signature types
***************

MCUboot supports various signature types.
The signature type specifies the algorithm used to sign the image.
You can calculate each signature on a hash of the image, prepared by MCUboot (referred to as pre-hash signatures).
Notably, the Ed25519 signature can also be directly calculated on the image itself.

MCUboot image hash algorithms
*****************************

MCUboot supports several hash algorithms to calculate the integrity of the image hash.
Typically, the default hash algorithm is sufficient for most applications, as MCUboot selects the most relevant one based on the system configuration.
However, you can customize it to meet specific requirements.

MCUboot recovery protocol
*************************

Mcuboot supports serial recovery protocols compatible with :ref:`MCUmgr <dfu_tools_mcumgr_cli>`, enabling device programming via serial connection instead of J-Link.
This feature allows direct upload of applications to the executable image bank and, depending on configuration, to other banks as well.
To use this feature, enable the ``CONFIG_MCUBOOT_SERIAL`` Kconfig option.
