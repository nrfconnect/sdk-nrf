The Zigbee protocol in |NCS| can be customized by enabling and configuring several Zigbee libraries.
This page lists options and steps required for configuring each of them.

Configuring Zigbee FOTA
***********************

The Zigbee Over The Air Device Firmware Upgrade (:ref:`lib_zigbee_fota`) library provides a mechanism to upgrade the firmware of the device through the Zigbee network.

To enable and configure the library, you must set the :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_FOTA` Kconfig option.
Other :ref:`Zigbee FOTA Kconfig options <lib_zigbee_fota_options>` can be used with default values.

Because the Zigbee OTA DFU performs the upgrade using the :ref:`lib_dfu_target` library, the are several non-Zigbee options that must be set to configure the update process:

* :option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_IMAGE_VERSION` - This option specifies the current image version.
* :option:`CONFIG_DFU_TARGET_MCUBOOT` - This option enables updates that are performed by MCUboot.
* :option:`CONFIG_IMG_MANAGER` - This option enables the support for managing the DFU image downloaded using MCUboot.
* :option:`CONFIG_IMG_ERASE_PROGRESSIVELY` - This option instructs MCUboot to erase the flash memory progressively.
  This allows to avoid long wait times at the beginning of the DFU process.

Configuring these options allows you to use Zigbee FOTA in the :ref:`zigbee_light_switch_sample` sample.
Alternatively, you can use :file:`ota_overlay.conf` file during the sample building process.

Enabling Zigbee FOTA in an application
======================================

If you want to use the Zigbee FOTA functionality in your application, you must add several code snippets to its main file:

* Because the Zigbee OTA DFU library provides only the definition of the OTA endpoint, the application has to include it inside the device context:

  .. code-block:: c

      #include <zigbee_fota.h>
      extern zb_af_endpoint_desc_t ota_upgrade_client_ep;
      ZBOSS_DECLARE_DEVICE_CTX_2_EP(<your_device>_ctx, ota_upgrade_client_ep, <your_application>_ep);

* The application is informed about the update status though a callback.
  The callback must reboot the device once the firmware update is completed:

  .. code-block:: c

      static void ota_evt_handler(const struct zigbee_fota_evt *evt)
      {
          switch (evt->id) {
          case ZIGBEE_FOTA_EVT_FINISHED:
              LOG_INF("Reboot application.");
              sys_reboot(SYS_REBOOT_COLD);
              break;
          }
      }

* Apart from the library initialization, the application must pass ZCL events to the Zigbee FOTA library.
  If the application does not implement additional ZCL event handlers, the Zigbee FOTA handler may be passed directly to the ZBOSS stack:

  .. code-block:: c

      /* Initialize Zigbee FOTA download service. */
      zigbee_fota_init(ota_evt_handler);
      /* Register callback for handling ZCL commands. */
      ZB_ZCL_REGISTER_DEVICE_CB(zigbee_fota_zcl_cb);

* The periodical OTA server discovery must be started from the signal handler.
  The application should pass the received signals to the Zigbee FOTA library:

  .. code-block:: c

      void zboss_signal_handler(zb_bufid_t bufid)
      {
          /* Pass signal to the OTA client implementation. */
          zigbee_fota_signal_handler(bufid);
          ...

* To inform the MCUboot about successful device firmware upgrade, the application must call the following function once it is sure that all intended functionalities work after the upgrade:

  .. code-block:: c

      boot_write_img_confirmed();

See the :file:`samples/zigbee/light_switch/src/main.c` file of the :ref:`zigbee_light_switch_sample` sample for an example implementation of the Zigbee FOTA in an application.

Generating Zigbee FOTA upgrade image
====================================

By enabling the Zigbee OTA DFU, the west tool will automatically generate the upgrade image.
To specify the target device of the generated image, use the following Kconfig options:

* :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_FOTA_COMMENT` - This option allows to specify a human-readable image name.
* :option:`CONFIG_ENABLE_ZIGBEE_FOTA_MIN_HW_VERSION` and :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_FOTA_MIN_HW_VERSION` - These options allow to specify the minimum hardware version of the device that will accept the generated image.
* :option:`CONFIG_ENABLE_ZIGBEE_FOTA_MAX_HW_VERSION` and :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_FOTA_MAX_HW_VERSION` - These options allow to specify the maximum hardware version of the device that will accept the generated image.

The manufacturer ID, image type and version of the generated image are obtained from the application settings.

The upgrade image will be created in a dedicated directory in the :file:`build/zephyr/` directory.

.. _ug_zigbee_configuring_components_application_utilities:

Configuring Zigbee application utilities
****************************************
The :ref:`lib_zigbee_application_utilities` library provides a set of components that are ready for use in Zigbee applications.

To enable and use this library, set the :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_APP_UTILS` Kconfig option.

For additional logs for this library, configure the :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_APP_UTILS_LOG_LEVEL` Kconfig option.
See :ref:`zigbee_ug_logging_logger_options` for more information.

Default signal handler
======================
The default signal handler provides the default logic for handling ZBOSS stack signals.
For more information, see :ref:`lib_zigbee_signal_handler`.

Afer enabling the Zigbee application utilities library, you can use this component by calling the :c:func:`zigbee_default_signal_handler` in the application's :c:func:`zboss_signal_handler` implementation.

.. _ug_zigbee_configuring_components_logger_ep:

Configuring Zigbee endpoint logger
**********************************

The Zigbee endpoint logger library provides an endpoint handler for parsing and logging incoming ZCL frames with all their fields.

To enable the endpoint logger library in your application, complete the following steps:

1. Enable the library by setting the :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_LOGGER_EP` Kconfig option.
2. Define the logging level for the library by setting the :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_LOGGER_EP_LOG_LEVEL` Kconfig option.
   See :ref:`zigbee_ug_logging_logger_options` for more information.
3. Include the required header file :file:`include/zigbee/zigbee_logger_eprxzcl.h` into your project.
4. Register :c:func:`zigbee_logger_eprxzcl_ep_handler` as handler for the given *your_ep_number* endpoint using :c:macro:`ZB_AF_SET_ENDPOINT_HANDLER`, after the device context is registered with :c:macro:`ZB_AF_REGISTER_DEVICE_CTX`, but before starting the Zigbee stack:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      ZB_AF_REGISTER_DEVICE_CTX(&your_device_ctx);
      ZB_AF_SET_ENDPOINT_HANDLER(*your_ep_number*, zigbee_logger_eprxzcl_ep_handler);

   For applications that implement multiple handlers, :c:func:`zigbee_logger_eprxzcl_ep_handler` can be registered as handler for each endpoint.

   .. note::
      If :ref:`lib_zigbee_shell` is already enabled and configured for the given endpoint, set the :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_SHELL_DEBUG_CMD` Kconfig option to enable the endpoint logger instead of registering a handler.
      This is because the Zigbee shell library registers its own handler for the endpoint.

For more information about the library, see :ref:`lib_zigbee_logger_endpoint`.

.. _ug_zigbee_configuring_components_shell:

Configuring Zigbee shell
************************

The Zigbee shell library implements a set of :ref:`Zigbee shell commands <zigbee_cli_reference>` that can be used with all Zigbee samples for testing and debugging.

|zigbee_shell_config|

To extend a sample with the Zigbee shell command support, set the following KConfig options:

* :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_SHELL` - This option enables Zigbee shell and Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:shell_api`.
* :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_SHELL_ENDPOINT` - This option specifies the endpoint number to be used by the Zigbee shell instance.
  The endpoint must be present at the device and you must not register an endpoint handler for this endpoint.
* :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_SHELL_DEBUG_CMD` - This option enables commands useful for testing and debugging.
  This option also enables logging of the incoming ZCL frames.
  Logging of the incoming ZCL frames uses the logging level set in :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_LOGGER_EP_LOG_LEVEL`.

  .. note::
     Using debug commands can make the device unstable.

* :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_SHELL_LOG_LEVEL` - This option sets the logging level for Zigbee shell logs.
  See :ref:`zigbee_ug_logging_logger_options` for more information.
