   :depth: 2

|NCS| delivers reference software and supporting libraries for developing low-power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor products.
It includes the TF-M, MCUboot and the Zephyr RTOS open source projects, which are continuously integrated and re-distributed with the SDK.

The |NCS| is where you begin building low-power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, and nRF91 Series devices.
nRF53 Series devices are now supported for production.
Wireless protocol stacks and libraries may indicate support for development or support for production for different series of devices based on verification and certification status.
See the release notes and documentation for those protocols and libraries for further information.

Changelog
*********

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

nRF9160
=======

* Added:

  * :ref:`at_monitor_readme` library that lets you reschedule and dispatch AT notifications from the Modem library AT interface to AT monitors.
  * :ref:`at_monitor_sample` sample that shows the usage of the :ref:`at_monitor_readme` library.
  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_rest` library that enables devices to use nRF Cloud's REST-based device API.

* Updated:

  * All samples

    * All samples built for the nRF9160 SoC now have the :ref:`nrf_modem` library enabled by default.

  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:

    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_uninit`, which can be used to uninitialize the nRF Cloud library.
      If :ref:`cloud_api_readme` is used, call :c:func:`cloud_uninit`.
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_shadow_device_status_update`, which sets the device status in the device's shadow.
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_modem_info_json_encode`, which encodes modem information into a cJSON object formatted for use with nRF Cloud.
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_service_info_json_encode`, which encodes service information into a cJSON object formatted for use with nRF Cloud.
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_client_id_get`, which returns the client ID used to identify the device with nRF Cloud.
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_tenant_id_get`, which returns the tenant ID used to identify a customer account with nRF Cloud.
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_register_gateway_state_handler` to implement a custom callback on shadow update events.
    * Added Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_GATEWAY`, which enables functionality to behave as an nRF Cloud gateway.
    * Added the option to use the P-GPS API independent of nRF Cloud MQTT transport.
    * Implemented functionality for the :c:enumerator:`NRF_CLOUD_EVT_SENSOR_DATA_ACK` event.
      The event is now generated when a valid tag value (NCT_MSG_ID_USER_TAG_BEGIN through NCT_MSG_ID_USER_TAG_END) is provided with the sensor data when calling either :c:func:`nrf_cloud_sensor_data_send` or :c:func:`nrf_cloud_shadow_update`.
    * Updated :c:func:`nrf_cloud_shadow_update` to expect that ``param->data.ptr`` points to a JSON string.
      Previously, a cJSON object was expected.
    * Updated :c:func:`nct_init` to perform FOTA initialization before setting the client ID.
      This fixes an issue that prevented an expected reboot during a modem FOTA update.
    * Removed the function ``nrf_cloud_sensor_attach()``, the associated structure ``nrf_cloud_sa_param``, and the event ``NRF_CLOUD_EVT_SENSOR_ATTACHED``.
      These items provided no useful functionality.

  * :ref:`serial_lte_modem` application:

    * Added IPv6 support to all SLM services.
    * Added the GNSS service to replace the existing GPS test functionality.
    * Added the optional support of location services from nRF Cloud, such as A-GPS, P-GPS, and cellular positioning.
    * Removed datatype in all sending AT commands.
      If no sending data is specified, switch data mode to receive and send any arbitrary data.
    * Added the :ref:`slm_data_mode` documentation page to explain the data mode mechanism and how it works.
    * Added the :ref:`SLM_AT_FOTA` documentation page to describe the FOTA service.

  * :ref:`asset_tracker_v2` application:

    * Changed the custom module responsible for controlling the LEDs to the :ref:`LEDs module <caf_leds>` from :ref:`lib_caf`.
    * Added support for A-GPS when configuring the application for AWS IoT.
    * Added support for P-GPS when configuring the application for AWS IoT.
    * Added a new :ref:`debug module <asset_tracker_v2_debug_module>` that implements support for `Memfault`_.
    * Added support for the :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library.

  * :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library:

    * Added deferred event reason :c:macro:`LWM2M_CARRIER_DEFERRED_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, which indicates that the LwM2M server is unavailable due to maintenance.
    * Removed error code :c:macro:`LWM2M_CARRIER_ERROR_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, which was used incorrectly to indicate a deferred event reason.

  * :ref:`lwm2m_carrier` sample - Adjusted the messages printed in :c:func:`lwm2m_carrier_event_handler` to reflect the updated event definitions in the :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library.
  * :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library - Added API to enable modem domain events.
  * :ref:`lib_modem_jwt` library - Updated :c:func:`modem_jwt_generate` to ensure the generated JWT has ``base64url`` encoding.
  * Board names:

    * The ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160ns`` and the ``nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuappns`` boards have been renamed respectively to ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns`` and ``nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp_ns``, in a change inherited from upstream Zephyr.
    * The ``thingy91_nrf9160ns`` board has been renamed to ``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` for consistency with the changes inherited from upstream Zephyr.

* Deprecated:

  * nRF9160: Asset Tracker has been deprecated in favor of :ref:`asset_tracker_v2`.
  * ``at_notif`` library library has been deprecated in favor of the :ref:`at_monitor_readme` library.
  * ``at_cmd`` library library has been deprecated in favor of Modem library's native AT interface.
  * :ref:`gps_api` driver has been deprecated in favor of the :ref:`nrfxlib:gnss_interface`.
