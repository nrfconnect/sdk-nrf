   :local:
   :depth: 2

|NCS| delivers reference software and supporting libraries for developing low-power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor products in the nRF52, nRF53, and nRF91 Series.
The SDK includes open source projects (TF-M, MCUboot, OpenThread, Matter, and the Zephyr RTOS), which are continuously integrated and re-distributed with the SDK.

Release notes might refer to "experimental" support for features, which indicates that the feature is incomplete in functionality or verification, and can be expected to change in future releases.
The feature is made available in its current state though the design and interfaces can change between release tags.
The feature will also be labelled with "EXPERIMENTAL" in Kconfig files to indicate this status.
Build warnings will be generated to indicate when features labelled EXPERIMENTAL are included in builds unless the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_WARN_EXPERIMENTAL` is disabled.

Highlights
**********

* Added experimental support for Nordic Distance Toolbox with examples. The software package adds phase-based distance measurement support for the nRF52 and nRF53 Series of devices.
* Added support for Amazon Frustration-Free Setup (FFS) for Matter devices.
* Added deep power-down mode to QSPI driver to optimize energy usage for solutions using an external flash memory.
* Added support for micro:bit v2 board.
* Added support for filtered ephemeris that improves A-GPS download size.
* Updated the support for Periodic Advertising with the SoftDevice Controller. It is no longer experimental.
* Updated the Zigbee solution on nRF5340. It is no longer experimental and is now Zigbee Platform Certification compliant.
* Replaced proprietary sockets with nrf_modem APIs that include link-time optimization, thereby reducing memory usage.

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`library <libraries>`.

Binary libraries
----------------

* Updated:

  * :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library:

    * Updated to v0.22.0.
      See the :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_changelog` for detailed information.

Common Application Framework (CAF)
----------------------------------

* Added:

  * A simple implementation of the :ref:`caf_ble_bond`.
    The implementation allows to erase bonds for default Bluetooth local identity.

  * :ref:`nRF Desktop settings loader <nrf_desktop_settings_loader>` is migrated to :ref:`lib_caf` as :ref:`CAF: Settings loader module <caf_settings_loader>`.

* Updated:

  * :ref:`caf_leds`:

    * Added:

      * New LED effect macro :c:macro:`LED_EFFECT_LED_BLINK2`.
      * A macro to pass color arguments between macro calls :c:macro:`LED_COLOR_ARG_PASS`.

  * :ref:`caf_ble_adv`:

    * Added:

      * Possibility of setting custom Bluetooth LE advertising intervals.

   * Updated:

     * Unify module ID reference location:

       * The array holding module reference objects is explicitly defined in linker script to avoid creating an orphan section. ``MODULE_ID`` macro and :c:func:`module_id_get` function now returns module reference from dedicated section instead of module name. The module name cannot be obtained from reference object directly. Instead, a helper function (:c:func:`module_name_get`) must be used.

* Fixed:

  * The known issue related to directed advertising in CAF (NCSDK-13058).
  * NULL dereferencing in :ref:`caf_sensor_manager` during :c:struct:`wake_up_event` handling for sensors that do not support trigger.

Bootloader libraries
--------------------

* Added a separate section for :ref:`lib_bootloader`.

Libraries for networking
------------------------

* Updated:

  * :ref:`lib_fota_download` library:

      * Standardized bootloader FOTA download to accept only full dual path names (for example :file:`path/to/s0.bin path/to/s1.bin`). Truncated dual path names (:file:`path/to/s0.bin s1.bin`) are no longer supported.

    * Fixed:

      * An issue where the application would not be notified of errors originating from :c:func:`download_with_offset`. In the HTTP update samples, this would result in the dfu start button interrupt being disabled after a connect error in :c:func:`download_with_offset` and after a disconnect during firmware download.
      * An issue where the :ref:`lib_fota_download` library restarted the firmware image download from an incorrect offset after a link-connection timeout.
        This resulted in an invalid image and required a restart of the firmware update process.

  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_agps` library:

    * Added a section on Optimizing cloud data downloads as part of adding support for  A-GPS filtered ephemerides mode when using MQTT with nRF Cloud.

    * Added A-GPS filtered ephemerides support for both MQTT and REST transports.

  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:

    * Added:

      * A-GPS filtered ephemerides support, with the ability to set matching threshold mask angle, for both MQTT and REST transports.

        * When filtered ephemerides is enabled, A-GPS assistance requests to cloud are limited to no more than once every two hours.

    * Updated:

      * MQTT connection error handling.
        Now, unacknowledged pings and other errors result in a transition to the disconnected state.
        This ensures that reconnection can take place.

      * The library to correctly trigger MQTT disconnection on nRF Cloud device removal.


  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_rest` library:

    * Updated:

      * The library to use the :ref:`lib_rest_client` library for REST API calls.
      * The library by adding the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_rest_send_device_message` function that sends a JSON message to nRF Cloud using the ``SendDeviceMessage`` endpoint.
      * The library by adding the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_rest_send_location` function that sends an NMEA sentence to nRF Cloud as a GPS-type device message.

  * :ref:`lib_lwm2m_client_utils` library:

    * Added support for LwM2M object ECID-Signal Measurement Information (object ID 10256).

  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_pgps` library:

    * Removed the word ALL from the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_REQUEST_UPON_INIT` option. Changed the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_pgps_init` function to use this to disable all three reasons for downloading P-GPS data, not just the full set.

DFU libraries
-------------

* Updated:

  * :ref:`lib_dfu_target` library:

    * Updated the implementation of modem delta upgrades in the DFU target library to use the new socketless interface provided by the :ref:`nrf_modem`. See the Modem delta upgrades section in the library documentation.

Modem libraries
---------------

* Updated:

  * :ref:`nrf_modem_lib_readme`:

    * The modem trace handling is moved from :file:`nrf_modem_os.c` to a new file :file:`nrf_modem_lib_trace.c`, which also provides the API for starting a trace session for a given time interval or until a given size of trace data is received.
      Updated the documentation with information about the Modem trace module.

    * Fixed:

      * A bug in the socket offloading component, where the :c:func:`recvfrom` wrapper could do an out-of-bounds copy of the sender's address, when the application is compiled without IPv6 support. In some cases, the out of bounds copy could indefinitely block the :c:func:`send` and other socket API calls.
      * A bug in the socket offloading component, where the :c:func:`accept` wrapper did not free the reserved file descriptor if the call to :c:func:`nrf_accept` failed. On subsequent failing calls to :c:func:`accept`, this bug could result in the OS running out of file descriptors.

  * :ref:`at_monitor_readme` library:

    * Added :c:macro:`AT_MONITOR_ISR` macro to monitor AT notifications in an interrupt service routine. See Deferred dispatching and Direct dispatching sections in the library documentation for more information.
    * Removed :c:func:`at_monitor_init` function and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_AT_MONITOR_SYS_INIT` option. The library now initializes automatically when enabled.

  * :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library:

    * Updated the library to parse AT command responses containing the response result, for example, ``OK`` or ``ERROR``.

  * :ref:`lib_location` library:

    * Updated the documentation by adding information about the changes to the library to support A-GPS filtered ephemerides mode when using MQTT with nRF Cloud and by listing the support of high location accuracy.

  * :ref:`sms_readme` library:

    * Updated the documentation to reflect the use of new AT API.

  * :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library:

    * Updated:

      * API calls that initialize the library will now return 0 if the library has already been initialized.
      * Documentation by adding information about LTE fallback mode. See the section Connection fallback mode in the library documentation.

    * Fixed:

      * An issue where subsequent calls to :c:func:`lte_lc_connect` or :c:func:`lte_lc_init_and_connect` could hang until timeout, and in some cases change the LTE mode.

* Removed:

  * AT command interface library.
  * AT command notifications library.

Scripts
=======

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`script <scripts>`.

Unity
-----

* Fixed a bug that resulted in the mocks for some functions not having the ``__wrap_`` prefix. This happened for functions declared with whitespaces between identifier and parameter list.

HID Configurator for nRF Desktop
--------------------------------

* Updated:

  * The script to recognize the bootloader variant as a DFU module variant for the configuration channel communication. The new implementation is backward compatible - the new version of the script checks for module name and acts accordingly. See the Performing DFU section in :ref:`nrf_desktop_config_channel_script` documentation.

  * Documentation on setting up the dependencies for Debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint operating system.

MCUboot
=======

The MCUboot fork in |NCS| (``sdk-mcuboot``) contains all commits from the upstream MCUboot repository up to and including ``1eedec3e79``, plus some |NCS| specific additions.

The code for integrating MCUboot into |NCS| is located in the :file:`ncs/nrf/modules/mcuboot` folder.

The following list summarizes both the main changes inherited from upstream MCUboot and the main changes applied to the |NCS| specific additions:

* Added:

  * Check of reset address in the incoming image validation phase. See :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_VERIFY_IMG_ADDRESS`.

* Updated:

  * Always call :c:func:`sys_clock_disable` in main since the empty :c:func:`sys_clock_disable` callback is provided if the platform does not support system clock disable capability.
  * Bootutil library to close flash_area after failure to read swap status information.
  * Allow image header bigger than 1 KB for encrypted images.
  * Zephyr:RSA to use a smaller SHA256 implementation.

* Fixed:

  * Zephyr/boot_serial_extension build failure on :c:macro:`MCUBOOT_LOG_MODULE` when LOG is disabled.
  * Status offset calculation in case of scratch area.
  * Build with image encryption using RSA (issue introduced by migration to MbedTLS 3.0.0).
  * Support for single application with serial recovery.

Zephyr
======

.. NOTE TO MAINTAINERS: All the Zephyr commits in the below git commands must be handled specially after each upmerge and each NCS release.

The Zephyr fork in |NCS| (``sdk-zephyr``) contains all commits from the upstream Zephyr repository up to and including ``45ef0d2``, plus some |NCS| specific additions.

For the list of upstream Zephyr commits (not including cherry-picked commits) incorporated into |NCS| since the most recent release, run the following command from the :file:`ncs/zephyr` repository (after running ``west update``):

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline 45ef0d2 ^zephyr-v2.7.0

For the list of |NCS| specific commits, including commits cherry-picked from upstream, run:

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline manifest-rev ^45ef0d2

The current |NCS| main branch is based on revision ``45ef0d2`` of Zephyr, which is located between v2.7.0 and v3.0.0 of Zephyr.

Matter (Project CHIP)
=====================

The Matter fork in the |NCS| (``sdk-connectedhomeip``) contains all commits from the upstream Matter repository up to, and including, ``77ab003e5fcd409cd225b68daa3cdaf506ed1107``.

The following list summarizes the most important changes inherited from the upstream Matter:

* Added:

  * Support for General Diagnostics, Software Diagnostics and Thread Network Diagnostics clusters.
  * Initial support for the Matter OTA (Over-the-air) Requestor role, used for updating the device firmware.

cddl-gen
========

The `cddl-gen`_ module has been updated from version 0.1.0 to 0.3.0.
Release notes for 0.3.0 can be found in :file:`ncs/nrf/modules/lib/cddl-gen/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

The change prompted some changes in the CMake for the module, notably:

* The CMake function ``target_cddl_source()`` was removed.
* The non-generated source files (:file:`cbor_encode.c` and :file:`cbor_decode.c`) and their accompanying header files are now added to the build when :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CDDL_GEN` is enabled.

Also, it prompted the following:

* The code of some libraries using cddl-gen (like :ref:`lib_fmfu_fdev`) has been regenerated.
* The sdk-nrf integration test has been expanded into three new tests.
