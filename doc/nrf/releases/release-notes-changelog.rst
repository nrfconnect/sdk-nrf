Matter fork
+++++++++++

The Matter fork in the |NCS| (``sdk-connectedhomeip``) contains all commits from the upstream Matter repository up to, and including, the ``SVE RC2`` tag.

The following list summarizes the most important changes inherited from the upstream Matter:

* Updated the factory data generation script with the feature for generating the onboarding code.
  You can now use the factory data script to generate a manual pairing code and a QR Code that are required to commission a Matter-enabled device over Bluetooth LE.
  Generated onboarding codes should be put on the device's package or on the device itself.
  For details, see the Generating onboarding codes section on the :doc:`matter:nrfconnect_factory_data_configuration` page in the Matter documentation.
* Introduced ``SLEEPY_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD`` parameter that makes the Matter sleepy device stay awake for a specified amount of time after network activity.

Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

nRF9160: Asset Tracker v2
-------------------------

* Added the integration of the :ref:`lib_lwm2m_client_utils` FOTA callback functionality.

* Updated:

  * The application now uses the function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_location_request_msg_json_encode` to create an nRF Cloud location request message.
  * The application now uses defines from the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library for string values related to nRF Cloud.

nRF9160: Serial LTE modem
-------------------------

* Added:

  * AT command ``#XWIFIPOS`` to get Wi-Fi location from nRF Cloud.
  * Support for *WRITE REQUEST* in TFTP client.

* Updated:

  * Use defines from the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library for nRF Cloud related string values.

* Fixed:

  * A bug in receiving large MQTT Publish message.

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

* Moved the LE Audio controller for the network core to the standalone :ref:`lib_bt_ll_acs_nrf53_readme` library.

* Added Kconfig options for setting periodic and extended advertising intervals.
  Search :ref:`Kconfig Reference <kconfig-search>` for ``BLE_ACL_PER_ADV_INT_`` and ``BLE_ACL_EXT_ADV_INT_`` to list all of them.

* Implemented :ref:`zephyr:zbus` for handling events from buttons and LE Audio.

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

* Updated the machine learning models (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_EDGE_IMPULSE_URI`) used by the application to ensure compatibility with the new Zephyr version.
* Simplified the over-the-air (OTA) device firmware update (DFU) configuration of nRF53 DK .
  The configuration relies on the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NCS_SAMPLE_MCUMGR_BT_OTA_DFU` Kconfig option.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Added:

  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_swift_pair_app`.
    The module is used to enable or disable the Swift Pair Bluetooth advertising payload depending on the selected Bluetooth peer (used local identity).
  * An application-specific string representing device generation (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_DEVICE_GENERATION <config_desktop_app_options>`).
    The generation allows to distinguish configurations that use the same board and bootloader, but are not interoperable.
    The value can be read through the :ref:`nrf_desktop_config_channel`.
    On the firmware side, fetching the values is handled by the :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu`.
  * Unpairing old peers right after a successful erase advertising procedure.
    This prevents blocking the bond slots until the subsequent erase advertising procedure is triggered.

* Updated:

  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu` automatically enables 8-bit write block size emulation (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_EMULATE_ONE_BYTE_WRITE_ACCESS`) to ensure that update images with sizes not aligned to word size can be successfully stored in the internal flash.
    The feature is not enabled if the MCUboot bootloader is used and the secondary slot is placed in an external flash (when :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_EXTERNAL_FLASH_MCUBOOT_SECONDARY` is enabled).
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_ble_latency` uses low latency for the active Bluetooth connection in case of the SMP transfer event and regardless of the event submitter module.
    Previously, the module lowered the connection latency only for SMP events submitted by the :ref:`caf_ble_smp`.
  * In the Fast Pair configurations, the bond erase operation is enabled for the dongle peer, which will let you change the bonded Bluetooth Central.
  * The `Swift Pair`_ payload is, by default, included for all of the Bluetooth local identities apart from the dedicated local identity used for connection with an nRF Desktop dongle.
    If a configuration supports both Fast Pair and a dedicated dongle peer (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_DONGLE_PEER_ENABLE <config_desktop_app_options>`), the `Swift Pair`_ payload is, by default, included only for the dongle peer.

Samples
=======

Bluetooth samples
-----------------

* :ref:`peripheral_hids_keyboard` and :ref:`peripheral_hids_mouse` samples register HID Service before Bluetooth is enabled (before calling the :c:func:`bt_enable` function).
  The :c:func:`bt_gatt_service_register` function can no longer be called after enabling Bluetooth and before loading settings.

* Removed the Bluetooth: External radio coexistence using 3-wire interface sample because of the removal of the 3-wire implementation.

* :ref:`peripheral_hids_mouse` sample:

  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SMP` Kconfig option is included when ``CONFIG_BT_HIDS_SECURITY_ENABLED`` is selected.
  * Fixed a CMake warning by moving the nRF RPC configuration (the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_RPC_THREAD_STACK_SIZE` Kconfig option) to a separate overlay config file.

* :ref:`direct_test_mode` sample:

  * Added:

    * Support for the :ref:`nrfxlib:mpsl_fem` Tx power split feature.
      The DTM command ``0x09`` for setting the transmitter power level takes into account the front-end module gain when this sample is built with support for front-end modules.
      The vendor-specific commands for setting the SoC output power and the front-end module gain are not available when the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DTM_POWER_CONTROL_AUTOMATIC` Kconfig option is enabled.
    * Support for +1 dBm, +2 dBm, and +3 dBm output power on the nRF5340 DK.

  * Changed the handling of the hardware erratas.

  * Removed a compilation warning when used with minimal pinout Skyworks FEM.

* :ref:`peripheral_uart` sample:

  * Fixed the unit of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_NUS_UART_RX_WAIT_TIME` Kconfig option to comply with the UART API.

Bluetooth mesh samples
----------------------

* Updated the configuration of advertising sets in all samples to match the new default values.
  See `Bluetooth mesh`_ for more information.
* Removed the :file:`hci_rpmsg.conf` file from all samples that support nRF5340 DK or Thingy:53.
  This configuration is moved to the :file:`ncs/nrf/subsys/bluetooth/mesh/hci_rpmsg_child_image_overlay.conf` file.
* :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_light_lc` sample is updated to demonstrate the use of sensor server to report additional useful information about the device.

nRF9160 samples
---------------

* :ref:`modem_shell_application` sample:

  * Updated the sample to use defines from the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library for string values related to nRF Cloud.
    Removed the inclusion of the file :file:`nrf_cloud_codec.h`.
  * Added sending of GNSS data to carrier library when the library is enabled.

* :ref:`https_client` sample:

  * Added IPv6 support and wait time for PDN to fully activate (including IPv6, if available) before looking up the address.

* :ref:`slm_shell_sample` sample:

  * Added support for the nRF7002 DK PCA10143.

* :ref:`lwm2m_client` sample:

  * Added:

    * Integration of the connection pre-evaluation functionality using the :ref:`lib_lwm2m_client_utils` library.

  * Updated:

    * The sample now integrates the :ref:`lib_lwm2m_client_utils` FOTA callback functionality.

* :ref:`pdn_sample` sample:

  * Updated the sample to show how to get interface address information using the :c:func:`nrf_getifaddrs` function.

* :ref:`nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service` sample:

  * Updated:

    * Increased the MCUboot partition size to the minimum necessary to allow bootloader FOTA.

* :ref:`nrf_cloud_rest_device_message` sample:

  * Added:

    * Overlays to use RTT instead of UART for testing purposes.

  * Updated:

    * The Hello World message sent to nRF Cloud now contains a timestamp (message ID).

Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) samples
---------------------------------

* :ref:`provisioning_image` sample:

  * Thet network core logic is now moved to the new sample :ref:`provisioning_image_net_core` instead of being a Zephyr module..

Thread samples
--------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Matter samples
--------------

* Updated the default settings partition size for all Matter samples from 16 kB to 32 kB.

  .. caution::
      This change can affect the Device Firmware Update (DFU) from the older firmware versions that were using the 16-kB settings size.
      Read more about this in the :ref:`ug_matter_device_bootloader_partition_layout` section of the Matter documentation.
      You can still perform DFU from the older firmware version to the latest firmware version, but you will have to change the default settings size from 32 kB to the value used in the older version.

* :ref:`matter_lock_sample` sample:

  * Added the Matter Nordic UART Service (NUS) feature, which allows controlling the door lock device remotely through Bluetooth LE using two simple commands: ``Lock`` and ``Unlock``.
    This feature is dedicated for the nRF52840 and the nRF5340 DKs.
