Common Application Framework (CAF)
----------------------------------

* Updated:

  * Unify module id reference location.
    The array holding module reference objects is explicitly defined in linker script to avoid creating an orphan section.
    ``MODULE_ID`` macro and :c:func:`module_id_get` function now returns module reference from dedicated section instead of module name.
    The module name can not be obtained from reference object directly, a helper function (:c:func:`module_name_get`) should be used instead.

Modem libraries
---------------

* :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library:
  * Can now parse AT command responses containing the response result, for example, ``OK`` or ``ERROR``.

sdk-nrfxlib
-----------

See the changelog for each library in the :doc:`nfxlib documentation <nrfxlib:README>` for additional information.
