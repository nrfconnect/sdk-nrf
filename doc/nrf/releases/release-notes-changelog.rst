For lists of protocol-specific changes, see `Protocols`_.

Bluetooth samples
-----------------

* Added:

  * :ref:`multiple_adv_sets` sample.

* Updated:

  * :ref:`peripheral_rscs` - Corrected the number of bytes for setting the Total Distance Value and specified the data units.
  * :ref:`direct_test_mode` - Added support for front-end module devices that support 2-pin PA/LNA interface with additional support for the Skyworks SKY66114-11 and the Skyworks SKY66403-11.
  * :ref:`peripheral_hids_mouse` - Added a notice about encryption requirement.

Libraries
=========

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`library <libraries>`.

Bluetooth libraries and services
--------------------------------

Updated:

* :ref:`rscs_readme` library:

  * Added units for :c:struct:`bt_rscs_measurement` members.

Common Application Framework (CAF)
----------------------------------

* Migrated :ref:`nRF Desktop settings loader <nrf_desktop_settings_loader>` to :ref:`lib_caf` as :ref:`CAF: Settings loader module <caf_settings_loader>`.

* Updated:

  * Unify module id reference location.
    The array holding module reference objects is explicitly defined in linker script to avoid creating an orphan section.
    ``MODULE_ID`` macro and :c:func:`module_id_get` function now returns module reference from dedicated section instead of module name.
    The module name can not be obtained from reference object directly, a helper function (:c:func:`module_name_get`) should be used instead.

Bootloader libraries
--------------------

* Added a separate section for :ref:`lib_bootloader`.

Modem libraries
---------------

* :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library:
  * Can now parse AT command responses containing the response result, for example, ``OK`` or ``ERROR``.

Libraries for networking
========================

* :ref:`lib_fota_download` library:

  * Fixed an issue where the application would not be notified of errors originating from inside :c:func:`download_with_offset`. In the http_update samples, this would result in the dfu start button interrupt being disabled after a connect error in :c:func:`download_with_offset` after a disconnect during firmware download.

sdk-nrfxlib
-----------

See the changelog for each library in the :doc:`nfxlib documentation <nrfxlib:README>` for additional information.

Other libraries
---------------

* Moved :ref:`lib_bootloader` to a section of their own.
  * Added write protection by default for the image partition.

Modem library
+++++++++++++

* |no_changes_yet_note|

Scripts
=======

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`script <scripts>`.

Partition Manager
-----------------

* |no_changes_yet_note|

HID Configurator
----------------

* Added:

  * HID Configurator now recognizes the bootloader variant as a DFU module variant for the configuration channel communication.
    The new implementation is not backward compatible, since new version of script checks for variant it expects firmware to support this request.

The MCUboot fork in |NCS| (``sdk-mcuboot``) contains all commits from the upstream MCUboot repository up to and including ``680ed07``, plus some |NCS| specific additions.
