Modem libraries
---------------

* :ref:`nrf_modem_lib_readme` library:

  * Fixed a bug in the socket offloading component, where the :c:func:`recvfrom` wrapper could do an out-of-bounds copy of the sender's address, when the application is compiled without IPv6 support. In some cases, the out of bounds copy could indefinitely block the :c:func:`send` and other socket API calls.

sdk-nrfxlib
-----------

See the changelog for each library in the :doc:`nfxlib documentation <nrfxlib:README>` for additional information.

MCUboot
=======

The MCUboot fork in |NCS| (``sdk-mcuboot``) contains all commits from the upstream MCUboot repository up to and including ``680ed07``, plus some |NCS| specific additions.

The code for integrating MCUboot into |NCS| is located in the :file:`ncs/nrf/modules/mcuboot` folder.

The following list summarizes both the main changes inherited from upstream MCUboot and the main changes applied to the |NCS| specific additions:

* Fixed support for Low Power in Zephyr's single-thread mode.
  See ``MCUBOOT_CPU_IDLE()`` macro.
* Switched USB CDC ACM serial recovery I/O device configuration from Kconfig to Devicetree with the compatible ``"zephyr,cdc-acm-uart"`` property.
* Switched UART serial recovery I/O device configuration from Kconfig to Devicetree using Zephyr's ``zephyr,console`` property of the chosen node.
* Fixed a deadlock issue with cryptolib selectors in Kconfig.
* Fixed an issue with the serial recovery skipping on nRF5340.
* Added cleanup of UARTE devices before chainloading the application.
  This allows the application to initialize the devices correctly and fixes potential missing output of the application's log.

Mcumgr
======

The mcumgr library contains all commits from the upstream mcumgr repository up to and including snapshot ``657deb65``.

The following list summarizes the most important changes inherited from upstream mcumgr:
