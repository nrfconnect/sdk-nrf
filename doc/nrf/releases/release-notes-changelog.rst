Bluetooth libraries and services
--------------------------------

* Added:

  * :ref:`cgms_readme` library.

* :ref:`bt_le_adv_prov_readme`:

  * Added:

    * Google Fast Pair advertising data provider (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_FAST_PAIR`).
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_TX_POWER_CORRECTION_VAL` option to TX power advertising data provider (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_TX_POWER`).
      The option adds a predefined value to the TX power, that is included in the advertising data.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_GAP_APPEARANCE_SD` option to GAP appearance data provider (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_GAP_APPEARANCE`).

  * Changed :c:member:`bt_le_adv_prov_adv_state.bond_cnt` to :c:member:`bt_le_adv_prov_adv_state.pairing_mode`.
    The information about whether the advertising device is looking for a new peer is more meaningful for the Bluetooth LE data providers.

* :ref:`bt_mesh` library:

  * :ref:`bt_mesh_dk_prov` module: Changed the UUID generation to prevent trailing zeros in the UUID.

    Migration note: To retain the legacy generation of UUID, enable the option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_DK_LEGACY_UUID_GEN`.

See `Bluetooth mesh samples`_ for the list of changes for the Bluetooth mesh samples.

* :ref:`nrf_bt_scan_readme`:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE_BACKEND_BITRATE` Kconfig option to enable the measurement of the modem trace backend bitrate.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE_BACKEND_BITRATE_LOG` Kconfig option to enable logging of the modem trace backend bitrate.

  * Updated:

    * The IPC IRQ priority is now set using the devicetree.
    * The EGU peripheral is no longer used to generate software interrupts to process network data.
