  * Fixed an issue that was causing an assertion failure in the :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_state` on the nRF Desktop peripheral device during the boot of the host device connected through USB.
  * The application switched to using generic configuration file scheme.
    It now uses application-specific :file:`prj.conf` files instead of build types selected through CMake build type variables.
    When selecting the build file, point to build type specific :file:`prj.conf` file using the ``CONF_FILE`` variable.
    For example, ``CONF_FILE=prj_release.conf`` is now used instead of ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ZRelease``.
  * Updated to use DTS overlays instead of KConfig configuration files for setting up external flash memory.

Pelion client
-------------

* Updated:

  * The application configuration files were switched to follow a generic scheme.
    When selecting the build file, instead of setting up a CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, point to build type specific prj file using CONF_FILE.
    E.g. CONF_FILE=prj_release.conf will now be used instead of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ZRelease.

    It now uses application-specific :file:`prj.conf` files instead of build types selected through CMake build type variables.
    When selecting the build file, point to build type specific :file:`prj.conf` file using the ``CONF_FILE`` variable.
    For example, ``CONF_FILE=prj_release.conf`` is now used instead of ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ZRelease``.

  * Added logging on modem errors.
  * Changed the return values on modem errors to -ENOEXEC to avoid conflicts with return of other positive values.

* A-GPS library:

  * The A-GPS library has been deprecated in favor of using the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_agps` library directly.

Libraries for networking
------------------------

  * Added functions :c:func:`nrf_cloud_rest_shadow_state_update` and :c:func:`nrf_cloud_rest_shadow_service_info_update` to the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_rest` library. They enable device shadow updates using REST.
  * Added state checks to functions :c:func:`nrf_cloud_agps_request`, :c:func:`nrf_cloud_cell_pos_request`, :c:func:`nrf_cloud_pgps_request`, and :c:func:`json_send_to_cloud`. These functions should be called only after the device has connected to the nRF Cloud `` d2c`` topic.

  * Removed GNSS socket API support.
  * Updated to always request ephemerides and almanacs. The application is now responsible for clearing the flags if P-GPS is enabled.

  * Changed :c:func:`nrf_cloud_pgps_init` to limit allowable :kconfig:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_NUM_PREDICTIONS` to an even number,
    and limited :kconfig:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_REPLACEMENT_THRESHOLD` to this value minus 2.
