Matter
------

* Added:

  * Support for the :ref:`ug_matter_configuring_optional_persistent_subscriptions` feature.
  * The Matter Nordic UART Service (NUS) feature to the :ref:`matter_lock_sample`.
    This feature allows using Nordic UART Service to control the device remotely through Bluetooth LE and adding custom text commands to a Matter sample.
    The Matter NUS implementation allows controlling the device regardless of whether the device is connected to a Matter network or not.
    The feature is dedicated for the Matter over Thread solution.
  * Documentation page about :ref:`ug_matter_device_configuring_cd`.

* Updated:

  * The :ref:`ug_matter` protocol page with a table that lists compatibility versions for the |NCS|, the Matter SDK, and the Matter specification.
  * The :ref:`ug_matter_tools` page with installation instructions for the ZAP tool, moved from the :ref:`ug_matter_creating_accessory` page.

See `Matter samples`_ for the list of changes for the Matter samples.

Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB)
-------------------------

  ESB supports a payload with a size of 64 bytes or more.

* Added:

  * The `use_fast_ramp_up` feature that reduces radio ramp-up delay from 130 µs to 40 µs.
  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ESB_NEVER_DISABLE_TX` Kconfig option as an experimental feature that enables the radio peripheral to remain in TXIDLE state instead of TXDISABLE when transmission is pending.

* Updated:

  * The number of PPI/DPPI channels used from three to six.
  * Events 6 and 7 from the EGU0 instance by assigning them to the ESB module.
  * The type parameter of the :c:func:`esb_set_tx_power` function to ``int8_t``.

Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

nRF9160: Asset Tracker v2
-------------------------

* Updated:

  * Use defines from the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library for nRF Cloud related string values.
  * The application now integrates the :ref:`lib_lwm2m_client_utils` FOTA callback functionality.
  * The application now uses the function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_location_request_msg_json_encode` to create an nRF Cloud location request message.

nRF9160: Serial LTE modem
-------------------------

* Added:

  * AT command ``#XWIFIPOS`` to get Wi-Fi location from nRF Cloud.

* Updated:

  * Use defines from the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library for nRF Cloud related string values.

* Fixed:

  * A bug in receiving large MQTT Publish message.

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

* Moved the LE Audio controller for the network core to the standalone :ref:`lib_bt_ll_acs_nrf53_readme` library.

* Added  Kconfig options for setting periodic and extended advertising intervals..
  Search :ref:`Kconfig Reference <kconfig-search>` for ``BLE_ACL_PER_ADV_INT_`` and ``BLE_ACL_EXT_ADV_INT_`` to list all of them.

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

* Updated the machine learning models (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_EDGE_IMPULSE_URI`) used by the application to ensure compatibility with the new Zephyr version.
* Simplified the over-the-air (OTA) device firmware update (DFU) configuration of nRF53 DK .
  The configuration relies on the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NCS_SAMPLE_MCUMGR_BT_OTA_DFU` Kconfig option.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Added the :ref:`nrf_desktop_swift_pair_app`. The module is used to enable or disable the Swift Pair Bluetooth advertising payload depending on the selected Bluetooth peer (used local identity).

* Updated:

  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu` automatically enables 8-bit write block size emulation (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_EMULATE_ONE_BYTE_WRITE_ACCESS`) to ensure that update images with sizes unaligned to word size can be successfully stored in the internal FLASH.
    The feature is not enabled if the MCUboot bootloader is used and the secondary slot is placed in an external FLASH (when :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_EXTERNAL_FLASH_MCUBOOT_SECONDARY` is enabled).
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_ble_latency` uses low latency for the active Bluetooth connection in case of the SMP transfer event and regardless of the event submitter module.
    Previously, the module lowered the connection latency only for SMP events submitted by the :ref:`caf_ble_smp`.
  * In the Fast Pair configurations, the bond erase operation is enabled for the dongle peer, which will let you change the bonded Bluetooth Central.
  * The `Swift Pair`_ payload is, by default, included for all of the Bluetooth local identities apart from the dedicated local identity used for connection with an nRF Desktop dongle.
    If a configuration supports both Fast Pair and a dedicated dongle peer (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_DONGLE_PEER_ENABLE <config_desktop_app_options>`), the `Swift Pair`_ payload is, by default, included only for the dongle peer.

Samples
=======

Bluetooth samples
-----------------

* :ref:`peripheral_hids_keyboard` and :ref:`peripheral_hids_mouse` samples register HID Service before Bluetooth is enabled (before calling the :c:func:`bt_enable` function).
  The :c:func:`bt_gatt_service_register` function can no longer be called after enabling Bluetooth and before loading settings.

* Removed:

  * The Bluetooth 3-wire coex sample because of the removal of the 3-wire implementation.

* :ref:`peripheral_hids_mouse` sample:

  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SMP` Kconfig option is included when ``CONFIG_BT_HIDS_SECURITY_ENABLED`` is selected.

* :ref:`direct_test_mode` sample:

  * Removed a compilation warning when used with minimal pinout Skyworks FEM.
  * Added support for the :ref:`nrfxlib:mpsl_fem` Tx power split feature.
    The DTM command ``0x09`` for setting the transmitter power level takes into account the front-end module gain when this sample is built with support for front-end modules.
    The vendor-specific commands for setting the SoC output power and the front-end module gain are not available when the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DTM_POWER_CONTROL_AUTOMATIC` Kconfig option is enabled.
  * Added support for +1 dBm, +2 dBm, and +3 dBm output power on the nRF5340 DK.

Bluetooth mesh samples
----------------------

      Remove the inclusion of the file :file:`nrf_cloud_codec.h`.

* :ref:`slm_shell_sample` sample:

  * Added:

    * Support for the nRF7002 DK PCA10143.

* :ref:`lwm2m_client` sample:

  * Updated:

    * The sample now integrates the :ref:`lib_lwm2m_client_utils` FOTA callback functionality.

* :ref:`nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service` sample:

  * Updated:

    * Increased the MCUboot partition size to the minimum necessary to allow bootloader FOTA.

* :ref:`nrf_cloud_rest_device_message` sample:

  * Added:

    * Overlays to use RTT instead of UART for testing purposes.

  * Updated:

    * The Hello World message sent to nRF Cloud now contains a timestamp (message ID).

Peripheral samples
------------------

* :ref:`radio_test` sample:

  * Added a workaround for the hardware `Errata 254`_ of the nRF52840 chip.
  * Added a workaround for the hardware `Errata 255`_ of the nRF52833 chip.
  * Added a workaround for the hardware `Errata 256`_ of the nRF52820 chip.
