The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

nRF9160
=======

* Added:

  * :ref:`at_monitor_readme` library:

    * A library to reschedule and dispatch AT notifications from the Modem library AT interface to AT monitors.

  * :ref:`at_monitor_sample` sample:

    * A sample to show the usage of the :ref:`at_monitor_readme` library.

  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_rest` library:

    * The library enables devices to use nRF Cloud's REST-based device API.

* Updated:

  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:

    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_uninit`, which can be used to uninitialize the nRF Cloud library.  If :ref:`cloud_api_readme` is used, call :c:func:`cloud_uninit`
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_shadow_device_status_update`, which sets the device status in the device's shadow.
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_modem_info_json_encode`, which encodes modem information into a cJSON object formatted for use with nRF Cloud.
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_service_info_json_encode`, which encodes service information into a cJSON object formatted for use with nRF Cloud.
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_client_id_get`, which returns the client ID used to identify the device with nRF Cloud.
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_tenant_id_get`, which returns the tenant ID used to identify a customer account with nRF Cloud.
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_register_gateway_state_handler` to implement a custom callback on shadow update events.
    * Added Kconfig option :kconfig:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_GATEWAY`, which enables functionality to behave as an nRF Cloud gateway.
    * Removed function ``nrf_cloud_sensor_attach()``, the associated structure ``nrf_cloud_sa_param``, and event ``NRF_CLOUD_EVT_SENSOR_ATTACHED``. These items provided no useful functionality.
    * Added the option to use the P-GPS API independent of nRF Cloud MQTT transport.

  * :ref:`serial_lte_modem` application:

    * Added a separate document page to explain data mode mechanism and how it works.
    * Removed datatype in all sending AT commands. If no sending data is specified, switch data mode to receive and send any arbitrary data.

    * Added IPv6 support to all SLM services.
    * Added the GNSS service to replace the existing GPS test functionality.
    * Added the optional support of location services from nRF Cloud, like A-GPS, P-GPS, and cellular positioning.

  * :ref:`asset_tracker_v2` application:

    * Changed the custom module responsible for controlling the LEDs to CAF LEDs module.
    * Added support for A-GPS when configuring the application for AWS IoT.
    * Added support for P-GPS when configuring the application for AWS IoT.

  * :ref:`at_cmd_readme` library:

    * The library has been deprecated in favor of Modem library's native AT interface.

  * :ref:`at_notif_readme` library:

    * The library has been deprecated in favor of the :ref:`at_monitor_readme` library.

  * :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library:

    * Removed error code :c:macro:`LWM2M_CARRIER_ERROR_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, which was used incorrectly to indicate a deferred event reason.

  * :ref:`lwm2m_carrier` sample:

    * Adjusted the messages printed in :c:func:`lwm2m_carrier_event_handler` to reflect the updated event definitions in the :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library.

  * Board names:

    * The ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160ns`` and the ``nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuappns`` boards have been renamed respectively to ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns`` and ``nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp_ns``, in a change inherited from upstream Zephyr.
    * The ``thingy91_nrf9160ns`` board has been renamed to ``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` for consistency with the changes inherited from upstream Zephyr.

Mcumgr
======

The mcumgr library contains all commits from the upstream mcumgr repository up to and including snapshot ``74e77ad08``.

The following list summarizes the most important changes inherited from upstream mcumgr:

* No changes yet

Zephyr
======

.. NOTE TO MAINTAINERS: All the Zephyr commits in the below git commands must be handled specially after each upmerge and each NCS release.

The Zephyr fork in |NCS| (``sdk-zephyr``) contains all commits from the upstream Zephyr repository up to and including ``14f09a3b00``, plus some |NCS| specific additions.

For a complete list of upstream Zephyr commits incorporated into |NCS| since the most recent release, run the following command from the :file:`ncs/zephyr` repository (after running ``west update``):

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline 14f09a3b00 ^v2.6.0-rc1-ncs1

For a complete list of |NCS| specific commits, run:

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline manifest-rev ^14f09a3b00

The current |NCS| master branch is based on the Zephyr v2.7 development branch.

Matter (Project CHIP)
=====================

The Matter fork in the |NCS| (``sdk-connectedhomeip``) contains all commits from the upstream Matter repository up to, and including, ``b77bfb047374b7013dbdf688f542b9326842a39e``.

=============

* Added:

  * User guide :ref:`ug_nrf_cloud`.

* Updated:

  * Renamed :ref:`ncs_release_notes_changelog` (this page).
