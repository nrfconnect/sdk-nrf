Libraries
=========

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`library <libraries>`.

Binary libraries
----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Bluetooth libraries and services
--------------------------------

* :ref:`bt_le_adv_prov_readme`:

  * Added the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_TX_POWER_CORRECTION_VAL` option to TX power advertising data provider (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_TX_POWER`).
    The option adds a predefined value to the TX power, that is included in the advertising data.
  * Changed :c:member:`bt_le_adv_prov_adv_state.bond_cnt` to :c:member:`bt_le_adv_prov_adv_state.pairing_mode`.
    The information about whether the advertising device is looking for a new peer is more meaningful for the Bluetooth LE data providers.

* :ref:`bt_mesh` library:

  * :ref:`bt_mesh_dk_prov` module: Changed the UUID generation to prevent trailing zeros in the UUID.

    Migration note: To retain the legacy generation of UUID, enable the option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_DK_LEGACY_UUID_GEN`.

See `Bluetooth mesh samples`_ for the list of changes for the Bluetooth mesh samples.

* :ref:`nrf_bt_scan_readme`:

  * Added the ability to use the module when the Bluetooth Observer role is enabled.

* :ref:`bt_fast_pair_readme` service:

  * Disabled automatic security re-establishment request as a peripheral (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_GATT_AUTO_SEC_REQ`) to allow the Fast Pair Seeker to control the security re-establishment.

Bootloader libraries
--------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Modem libraries
---------------

* :ref:`modem_info_readme` library:

  * Removed :c:func:`modem_info_json_string_encode` and :c:func:`modem_info_json_object_encode` functions.
  * Removed network_mode field from :c:struct:`network_param`.
  * Removed ``MODEM_INFO_NETWORK_MODE_MAX_SIZE``.
  * Removed ``CONFIG_MODEM_INFO_ADD_BOARD``.

* :ref:`nrf_modem_lib_readme` library:

  * Updated:

    * The :c:func:`getaddrinfo` function to return ``EAFNOSUPPORT`` instead of ``EPROTONOSUPPORT`` when socket family is not supported.
    * The :c:func:`bind` function to return ``EAFNOSUPPORT`` instead of ``ENOTSUP`` when socket family is not supported.
    * The :c:func:`sendto` function to return ``EAFNOSUPPORT`` instead of ``ENOTSUP`` when socket family is not supported.
    * The :c:func:`connect` function to not override the error codes set by the Modem library when called with raw parameters (non-IP).

  * Fixed:

    * An issue where the :c:func:`getsockopt` function causes segmentation fault when the ``optlen`` parameter is provided as ``NULL``.
    * An issue where the :c:func:`recvfrom` function causes segmentation fault when the ``from`` and ``fromlen`` parameters are provided as ``NULL``.

Libraries for networking
------------------------

* :ref:`lib_multicell_location` library:

  * Removed the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MULTICELL_LOCATION_MAX_NEIGHBORS`.
    The maximum number of supported neighbor cell measurements for HERE location services depends on the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_NEIGHBOR_CELLS_MAX` Kconfig option.

* :ref:`lib_download_client` library:

  * Updated the library so that it does not retry download on disconnect.
  * Fixed a race condition when starting the download.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:

  * Updated:

    * The stack size of the MQTT connection monitoring thread can now be adjusted by setting the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_CONNECTION_POLL_THREAD_STACK_SIZE` Kconfig option.

  * Removed:

    * An unused parameter of the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_connect` function.
