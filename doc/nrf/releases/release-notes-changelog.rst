This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

nRF9160: Asset Tracker v2
-------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

nRF9160: Serial LTE modem
-------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

* Updated the machine learning models (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_EDGE_IMPULSE_URI`) used by the application so that they are now hosted by Nordic Semiconductor.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Added Kconfig options to enable handling of the power management events for the following nRF Desktop modules:

  * :ref:`nrf_desktop_board` - The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BOARD_PM_EVENTS <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option.
  * :ref:`nrf_desktop_motion` - The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_PM_EVENTS <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option.
  * :ref:`nrf_desktop_ble_latency` - The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_LATENCY_PM_EVENTS <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option.

  All listed Kconfig options are enabled by default and depend on the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_PM_EVENTS` Kconfig option.

* Updated:

  * Set the max compiled-in log level to ``warning`` for the USB HID class (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USB_HID_LOG_LEVEL_CHOICE`) and reduce the log message levels used in the :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state_pm` source code.
    This is done to avoid flooding logs during USB state changes.
  * If the USB state is set to :c:enum:`USB_STATE_POWERED`, the :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state_pm` restricts the power down level to the :c:enum:`POWER_MANAGER_LEVEL_SUSPENDED` instead of requiring :c:enum:`POWER_MANAGER_LEVEL_ALIVE`.
    This is done to prevent the device from powering down and waking up multiple times when an USB cable is connected.

Thingy:53: Matter weather station
---------------------------------

* Added support for the nRF7002 Wi-Fi expansion board.

Samples
=======

Bluetooth samples
-----------------

* :ref:`direct_test_mode` sample:

  * Added:

    * Support for the nRF52840 DK.

Bluetooth mesh samples
----------------------

* :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_sensor_client` sample:

  * Fixed an issue with the sample not fitting into RAM size on the nrf52dk_nrf52832 board.

nRF9160 samples
---------------

* :ref:`nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service` sample:

  * Added documentation for using the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_alert` and :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_log` libraries.
  * Changed the :file:`overlay_nrfcloud_logging.conf` file to enable JSON logs by default.

* :ref:`http_application_update_sample` sample:

   * Updated credentials for the HTTPS connection.

* :ref:`http_full_modem_update_sample` sample:

   * Updated credentials for the HTTPS connection.

* :ref:`http_modem_delta_update_sample` sample:

   * Updated credentials for the HTTPS connection.

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`script <scripts>`.

|no_changes_yet_note|

* :ref:`west_sbom`:

  * Changed:

    * To reduce RAM usage, the script now runs the `Scancode-Toolkit`_ detector in a single process.
      This change slows down the licenses detector, because it is no longer executed simultaneously on all files.

MCUboot
=======

The MCUboot fork in |NCS| (``sdk-mcuboot``) contains all commits from the upstream MCUboot repository up to and including ``6902abba270c0fbcbe8ee3bb56fe39bc9acc2774``, with some |NCS| specific additions.

The code for integrating MCUboot into |NCS| is located in the :file:`ncs/nrf/modules/mcuboot` folder.

The following list summarizes both the main changes inherited from upstream MCUboot and the main changes applied to the |NCS| specific additions:

|no_changes_yet_note|

Zephyr
======

.. NOTE TO MAINTAINERS: All the Zephyr commits in the below git commands must be handled specially after each upmerge and each nRF Connect SDK release.

The Zephyr fork in |NCS| (``sdk-zephyr``) contains all commits from the upstream Zephyr repository up to and including ``4bbd91a9083a588002d4397577863e0c54ba7038``, with some |NCS| specific additions.

For the list of upstream Zephyr commits (not including cherry-picked commits) incorporated into nRF Connect SDK since the most recent release, run the following command from the :file:`ncs/zephyr` repository (after running ``west update``):

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline 4bbd91a908 ^e1e06d05fa

For the list of |NCS| specific commits, including commits cherry-picked from upstream, run:

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline manifest-rev ^4bbd91a908

The current |NCS| main branch is based on revision ``4bbd91a908`` of Zephyr.
