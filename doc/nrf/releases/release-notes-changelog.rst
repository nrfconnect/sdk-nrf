        The trace thread is synchronized with the initialization and shutdown operations of the Modem library.
      * The Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE_ENABLED` is replaced by the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE`. The Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE_ENABLED` is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.
      * Added the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_MEM_DIAG` option to enable the :c:func:`nrf_modem_lib_diag_stats_get` function that retrieves memory runtime statistics, replacing the ``nrf_modem_lib_heap_diagnose`` and ``nrf_modem_lib_shm_tx_diagnose`` functions.
      * Consolidated ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_DEBUG_ALLOC`` and ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_DEBUG_SHM_TX_ALLOC`` into the new :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_MEM_DIAG_ALLOC` option.
      * Consolidated ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_HEAP_DUMP_PERIODIC`` and ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_SHM_TX_DUMP_PERIODIC`` into the new :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_MEM_DIAG_DUMP` option.
      * Consolidated ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_HEAP_DUMP_PERIOD_MS`` and ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_SHMEM_TX_DUMP_PERIOD_MS`` into the new :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_MEM_DIAG_DUMP_PERIOD_MS` option.

      * The following Kconfig options:

        * ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE_THREAD_PROCESSING``
        * ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE_HEAP_SIZE``
        * ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE_HEAP_SIZE_OVERRIDE``
        * ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE_HEAP_DUMP_PERIODIC``
        * ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE_HEAP_DUMP_PERIOD_MS``
        * ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_DEBUG_ALLOC``

        * ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_SHMEM_TX_DUMP_PERIOD_MS``

      * The following functions:

        * ``nrf_modem_lib_trace_start``
        * ``nrf_modem_lib_trace_stop``
        * ``nrf_modem_lib_heap_diagnose``
        * ``nrf_modem_lib_shm_tx_diagnose``

  * :ref:`lib_location` library:

    * Changed timeout parameters' type from uint16_t to int32_t, unit from seconds to milliseconds, and value to disable them from 0 to SYS_FOREVER_MS.
      This change is done to align with Zephyr's style for timeouts.
    * Fixed an issue with P-GPS predictions not being used to speed up GNSS when first downloaded.

  * :ref:`modem_info_readme` library:

    * Removed CONFIG_REST_CLIENT_SCKT_SEND_TIMEOUT and CONFIG_REST_CLIENT_SCKT_RECV_TIMEOUT.
    * Updated to handle a zero timeout value as "no timeout" (wait forever) to avoid immediate timeouts.

  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_rest` library:

    * Updated the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_rest_send_location` function to accept a :c:struct:`nrf_cloud_gnss_data` pointer instead of an NMEA sentence.

Libraries for NFC
-----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Other libraries
---------------

* Added:

  * :ref:`nrf_rpc_ipc_readme` library.
  * :ref:`lib_identity_key` library.

* :ref:`lib_flash_patch` library:

  * Allow the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DISABLE_FLASH_PATCH` Kconfig option to be used on the nRF52833 SoC.

* :ref:`doc_fw_info` module:

  * Fixed a bug where MCUboot would experience a fault when using the :ref:`doc_fw_info_ext_api` feature.

* :ref:`nrf_rpc_ipc_readme`:

  * This library can use different transport implementation for each nRF RPC group.
  * Memory for remote procedure calls is now allocated on a heap instead of the calling thread stack.

* :ref:`emds_readme`

  * Updated :c:func:`emds_entry_add` to no longer use heap, but instead require a pointer to the dynamic entry structure :c:struct:`emds_dynamic_entry`.
    The dynamic entry structure should be allocated in advance.

* :ref:`mod_memfault`:

  * Added default metrics for Bluetooth.

Common Application Framework (CAF)
----------------------------------

* :ref:`caf_ble_adv`:

  * Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_BLE_ADV_FILTER_ACCEPT_LIST` Kconfig option.
    The option is used instead of :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FILTER_ACCEPT_LIST` option to enable the filter accept list.
  * Integrated :ref:`bt_le_adv_prov_readme`.
    The subsystem is now used instead of the :file:`*.def` file to configure advertising data and scan response data.
  * Bluetooth device name is no longer automatically included in scan response data.
    A dedicated data provider (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_DEVICE_NAME`) can be used to add the Bluetooth device name to the scan response data.
  * Added :c:struct:`ble_adv_data_update_event` that can be used to trigger update of advertising data and scan response data during undirected advertising.
    When the event is received, the module gets new data from providers and updates advertising payload.
  * Added a wakeup call when connection is made in the grace period.
    With this change, the call wakes up the whole system to avoid inconsistent power state between modules.

* :ref:`caf_ble_state`:

  * Running on Bluetooth Peripheral no longer automatically send security request immediately after Bluetooth LE connection is established.
    The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_BLE_STATE_SECURITY_REQ` can be used to enable this feature.
    The option can be used for both Bluetooth Peripheral and Bluetooth Central.

* :ref:`caf_sensor_data_aggregator`:

  * Added unit tests for the library.

* :ref:`caf_sensor_manager`:

  * No longer uses floats to calculate and determine if the sensor trigger is activated.
    This is because the float uses more space.
    Also, data sent to :c:struct:`sensor_event` uses :c:struct:`sensor_value` instead of float.
