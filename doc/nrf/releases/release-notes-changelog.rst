* :ref:`lwm2m_client` sample:

  * Added support for Thingy:91.
  * Added more LwM2M objects.
  * LwM2M sensor objects now uses the actual sensors available to the Thingy:91. If the nRF9160 DK is used, it uses simulated sensors instead.

  * Added a new shell command ``rest`` for sending simple REST requests and receiving responses to them.

Zigbee samples
--------------

* Added:

   * :ref:`Zigbee shell <zigbee_shell_sample>` sample.

Drivers
=======

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`driver <drivers>`.

Libraries
=========

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`library <libraries>`.

Common Application Framework (CAF)
----------------------------------

Added:

* :ref:`caf_preview_sample` sample.
* :ref:`caf_ble_state_pm` CAF module.
* :ref:`caf_buttons_pm_keep_alive`.

Updated:

* :ref:`caf_power_manager` documentation page with the state transition diagram.
* The power management support in modules is now enabled by default when the :kconfig:`CONFIG_CAF_PM_EVENTS` Kconfig option is enabled.
* The :ref:`caf_power_manager` now has a dependency on :kconfig:`CONFIG_PM_POLICY_APP`, which is required by the application that is using the :ref:`caf_power_manager` to link.

Modem libraries
---------------

* :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library:

  * Changed the value of an invalid E-UTRAN cell ID from zero to UINT32_MAX for the LTE_LC_EVT_NEIGHBOR_CELL_MEAS event.
  * Added support for multiple LTE event handlers. Thus, deregistration is not possible by using lte_lc_register_handler(NULL) anymore and it is done by the :c:func:`lte_lc_deregister_handler` function in the API.
  * Added neighbor cell measurement search type parameter in :c:func:`lte_lc_neighbor_cell_measurement`.
  * Added timing advance measurement time to current cell data in :c:enum:`LTE_LC_EVT_NEIGHBOR_CELL_MEAS` event.
  * Updated the library to use the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem_at` API and the :ref:`at_monitor_readme` library for AT commands.
  * Added support for periodic search configuration. API functions have been added to set, read and clear the configuration, and to request extra searches.

* :ref:`nrf_modem_lib_readme` library:

  * Added a possibility to create native sockets when nRF91 socket offloading is enabled.

* :ref:`pdn_readme` library:

  * Added an optional ``family`` parameter to :c:func:`pdn_activate`, which is used to report when the IP family of a PDN changes after activation.

Libraries for networking
------------------------

* :ref:`lib_lwm2m_client_utils` library:

  * Added support for Firmware Update object to use :ref:`lib_fota_download` library for downloading firmware images.
  * Added support for full modem firmware update.

* :ref:`lib_multicell_location` library:

  * Updated to only request neighbor cell measurements when connected and to only copy neighbor cell measurements if they exist.
  * Added support for Polte location service.
  * Removed device ID from the :c:func:`multicell_location_get` parameter list. nRF Cloud and HERE did not use it. Skyhook will now set modem UUID as its device ID.
  * Selection of location service changed from compile-time to runtime configuration.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:

  * Removed GNSS socket API support from A-GPS and P-GPS.
  * Added support for sending data to a new bulk endpoint topic that is supported in nRF Cloud.
    A message published to the bulk topic is typically a combination of multiple messages.
  * Changed REST API for A-GPS to use GNSS interface structure instead of GPS driver structure.
    Also changed from GPS driver ``GPS_AGPS_`` request types to ``NRF_CLOUD_AGPS_`` request types.
  * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_jwt_generate` that generates a JWT using the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library's configured values.
  * Added handling of MQTT ping failures and MQTT input failures.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_agps` library:

  * Removed GNSS socket API support.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_pgps` library:

  * Fixed an issue with :kconfig:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_TRANSPORT_NONE` to ensure predictions are properly stored.
  * Fixed error handling associated with :kconfig:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_TRANSPORT_NONE`.
  * Added :c:func:`nrf_cloud_pgps_request_reset` so P-GPS application request handler can indicate failure to process the request.
    This ensures the P-GPS library tries the request again.
  * Added :kconfig:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_SOCKET_RETRIES`.
  * Changed :c:func:`nrf_cloud_pgps_init` to limit allowable :kconfig:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_NUM_PREDICTIONS` to an even number,
    and limited :kconfig:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_REPLACEMENT_THRESHOLD` to this value minus 2.

* :ref:`lib_rest_client` library:

  * Added REST client library for sending REST requests and receiving their responses.

* :ref:`lib_aws_iot` library:

  * Added handling of MQTT ping failures and MQTT input failures.

* :ref:`lib_azure_iot_hub` library:

  * Added handling of MQTT ping failures and MQTT input failures.
  * Updated the API version used in MQTT connection to Azure IoT Hub to 2020-09-30.

Libraries for NFC
-----------------

* Added:

  * :ref:`nfc_launch_app` library.

Trusted Firmware-M libraries
----------------------------

Other libraries
---------------

* Added API documentation and :ref:`conceptual documentation page <wave_gen>` for the wave generator library.

* :ref:`event_manager` library:

  * Increased number of supported Event Manager events.

  * Make the checking for ``hw_unique_key_write_random()`` more strict; panic if any key is unwritten after writing random keys.
  * Refactored the ``HUK_HAS_*`` macros to be defined/undefined instead of 1/0.
  * Added a new sample :ref:`hw_unique_key_usage` showing how to use a hardware unique key to derive an encryption key.
    The sample can be run with or without TF-M.
  * Fixed ``hw_unique_key_is_written()`` which would previously trigger a fault under certain circumstances.

* :ref:`profiler` library:

  * Updated Python scripts to use multiple processes that communicate over sockets.
  * Increase the number of supported profiler events.
  * Added a special profiler event for indicating a situation where the profiler's data buffer has overflowed and some events have been dropped, which causes the device to stop sending events.

* :ref:`lib_spm`:

  * Fixed the NCSDK-5156 issue with the size calculation for the non-secure callable region, which prevented users from adding a large number of custom secure services.
  * All EGU peripherals, instead of just EGU1 and EGU2, are now configurable to be non-secure and are configured as non-secure by default.


Libraries for Zigbee
--------------------

* Added ZCL commands to the :ref:`Zigbee shell <lib_zigbee_shell>` library.
* Fixes and improvements in :ref:`Zigbee Shell  <lib_zigbee_shell>` library.
