|NCS| delivers reference software and supporting libraries for developing low-power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor products in the nRF52, nRF53, nRF70, and nRF91 Series.
The SDK includes open source projects (TF-M, MCUboot, OpenThread, Matter, and the Zephyr RTOS), which are continuously integrated and redistributed with the SDK.

Release notes might refer to "experimental" support for features, which indicates that the feature is incomplete in functionality or verification, and can be expected to change in future releases.
To learn more, see :ref:`software_maturity`.

Highlights
**********

This minor release adds the following changes on top of the :ref:`nRF Connect SDK v2.1.0 <ncs_release_notes_210>`, :ref:`nRF Connect SDK v2.1.1 <ncs_release_notes_211>`, and :ref:`nRF Connect SDK v2.1.2 <ncs_release_notes_212>`:

* Updates the Matter ZAP Tool revision to be compatible with the :file:`zap` files that define the Data Model in |NCS| Matter samples.
* BluetoothÂ® fixes:

  * An issue in MPSL where the controller would assert when a Bluetooth role was running.
  * An issue in MPSL where the controller would abandon a link, causing a disconnect on the remote side.
  * An issue where RPA (Random Private Address) would not be changed when it should when the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_EXT_ADV` Kconfig option was enabled.

* UART driver fixes:

  * Fixed an issue where re-enabling UART after calling :c:func:`uart_rx_disable` too early could cause random hardware faults.
  * Fixed an issue where NULL pointer was de-referenced if ``PM_DEVICE_ACTION_RESUME`` action was requested.

See :ref:`ncs_release_notes_213_changelog` for the complete list of changes.
