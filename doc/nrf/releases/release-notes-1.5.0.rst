Changelog
*********

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

nRF9160
=======

* Added:

  * :ref:`asset_tracker_v2` application, which is a low-power asset tracking example for nRF9160 DK and Thingy:91.
  * :ref:`fmfu_smp_svr_sample` sample, which shows how to add the full modem serial update functionality to an application using SMP Server.
  * :ref:`http_full_modem_update_sample` sample, which demonstrates how to add full modem upgrade support to an application. Note that this requires an external flash memory of a minimum of 2 MB to work, hence the sample will only work on the nRF9160 DK v0.14.0 or later.
  * :ref:`http_modem_delta_update_sample` sample, which demonstrates how to add delta modem upgrade support to an application.
  * :ref:`lib_fmfu_mgmt`, which is a new library that implements parts of the mcumgr management protocol for doing full modem serial updates.

* Updated:

  * :ref:`asset_tracker` application - Updated to use the new FOTA (fota_v2) based on nRF Connect for Cloud.
  * :ref:`serial_lte_modem` application:

    * Fixed an issue where FOTA downloads were interrupted if an AT command was issued.
    * Fixed an issue with overflowing HTTP request buffers.
    * Fixed issues with TCP/UDP server restart.
    * Added support for allowing only specified TCP/TLS client IP addresses (using the #XTCPFILTER command).
    * Fixed the unsolicited result code (URC) message format following the 3GPP TS27.007 specification.
    * Fixed a bug that occurred when the size of an AT command was exactly the maximum buffer size.
    * Optimized SRAM usage.
    * Disabled external XTAL usage for UARTE by default.
    * Added a recovery mechanism for cases where a UART frame error happens.
    * Enhanced data mode support for TCP/UDP proxy.

  * :ref:`lwm2m_client` sample - Added handling of network failures. The sample now tries to reconnect to the LTE network when a failure is reported.
  * :ref:`nrf_coap_client_sample` sample - Updated the default server URL to ``californium.eclipseprojects.io``.
  * :ref:`mqtt_simple_sample` sample - Updated the default server URL to ``mqtt.eclipseprojects.io``.
  * Extracted the certificate, button, and LED handling functionality from :ref:`http_application_update_sample` sample to :file:`samples/nrf9160/http_update/common`, to share them with :ref:`http_modem_delta_update_sample` sample.
  * Moved the :ref:`http_application_update_sample` sample from :file:`samples/nrf9160/http_application_update/` to :file:`samples/nrf9160/http_update/application_update`.
  * :ref:`lib_download_client` library:

    * Reintroduced the optional TCP timeout (enabled by default) on the TCP socket that is used for the download.
      Upon timeout on a TCP socket, the HTTP download will fail and the ``ETIMEDOUT`` error will be returned via the callback handler.
    * Added an option to set the hostname for TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) extension.
      This option is valid only when TLS is enabled.

  * :ref:`lib_date_time` library :

    * Added an API to check if the Date-Time library has obtained a valid date-time. If the function returns false, it implies that the library has not yet obtained valid date-time to base its calculations and time conversions on, and hence other API calls that depend on the internal date-time will fail.


  * :ref:`lib_fota_download` library - Enabled SNI TLS extension for HTTPS downloads.
  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:

    * nRF Connect for Cloud FOTA replaced AWS Jobs as the FOTA mechanism for devices connected to nRF Connect for Cloud.
    * Removed :option:`CONFIG_CLOUD_API` dependency from :option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_CONNECTION_POLL_THREAD`.
    * Added a new API :c:func:`nrf_cloud_send` that can be used for sending pre-encoded data to specified endpoint topics in nRF Connect for Cloud.

  * :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library - The library can now parse AT command strings with negative numbers in the range supported by the int32_t type.
  * :ref:`lib_azure_iot_hub` library - Improved the internal connection state handling.
  * :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library - Added support for manufacturer-specific default eDRX/PSM values.
  * :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library - Updated to v0.10.2. See :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_changelog` for details.

* Removed:

  * USB-UART bridge sample

DFU target
----------

* Added:

  * New target ``dfu_target_full_modem``, which is used for full modem firmware updates. This requires an external flash memory of a minimum of 2 MB to work.

* Updated:

  * Renamed ``dfu_target_modem`` to ``dfu_target_modem_delta``.
  * Moved the ``dfu_target`` code from :file:`subsys/dfu` to :file:`subsys/dfu/dfu_target`.
  * Extracted the stream flash memory functionality from ``dfu_target_mcuboot`` to ``dfu_target_stream_flash`` to facilitate code reuse for other ``dfu_targets``, which write large objects to the flash memory.

nRF Desktop
-----------

Added selective HID report subscription in the USB state.
This allows the USB HID instance on the peripheral to subscribe only for a subset of HID reports.
If USB does not subscribe for the given HID report, Bluetooth LE HIDs can still receive it.

Common
======

The following changes are relevant for all device families.

Edge Impulse
------------

* Added :ref:`ei_wrapper` library that runs the machine learning model.
* Added :ref:`ei_wrapper_sample` sample that demonstrates the functionality of :ref:`ei_wrapper`.

Trusted Firmware-M
------------------

* Added a simple sample :ref:`tfm_hello_world` that demonstrates how to integrate TF-M in an application.
* Enabled the use of platform code that resides outside of the Trusted Firmware-M repository.
  This allows configurable memory partitioning in the |NCS|.
* Added support for running the :ref:`download_sample` sample with TF-M.

Partition Manager
-----------------

* Changed the naming convention for partition names in ``pm.yml`` and ``pm_static.yml``.
* Updated Partition Manager to prevent users from using partition names in ``pm.yml`` and ``pm_static.yml`` that match the names of the child images that define them in ``CMakeLists.txt``:

  * If the invalid naming scheme is used in ``pm.yml`` files, Partition Manager will now fail the builds.
  * If the invalid naming scheme is used in ``pm_static.yml`` files, the build will instead print a warning prompting the user to change this, if possible.
* Renamed ``b0`` and ``b0n`` container partitions to ``b0_container`` and ``b0n_container``, respectively.
* Renamed ``b0_image`` and ``b0n_image`` image partitions to appropriately match their child image name, ``b0`` and ``b0n``, respectively.

  **Migration notes:** While in development, you should rename partitions appropriately.
  You can still build firmware updates under the invalid scheme, but they will still be built with the improper sizes for the related partitions.
