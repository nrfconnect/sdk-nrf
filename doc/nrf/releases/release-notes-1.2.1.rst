|NCS| v1.2.1 Release Notes
##########################

|NCS| delivers reference software and supporting libraries for developing low-power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor products.
It includes the MCUboot and the Zephyr RTOS open source projects, which are continuously integrated and re-distributed with the SDK.

|NCS| v1.2.1 supports product development with the nRF9160 Cellular IoT device.
It contains reference applications, sample source code, and libraries for developing low-power wireless applications with nRF52 and nRF53 Series devices, though support for these devices is incomplete and not recommended for production.

.. note::

   Before this release, the |NCS| moved to a new GitHub organization, `nrfconnect <https://github.com/nrfconnect>`_.
   All repositories were renamed to provide clear and concise names that better reflect the composition of the codebase.
   If you are a new |NCS| user, there are no actions you need to take.
   If you used previous releases of the |NCS|, you should :ref:`point your repositories to the right remotes <repo_move>`.
