|NCS| delivers reference software and supporting libraries for developing low-power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor products in the nRF52, nRF53, nRF70, and nRF91 Series.
The SDK includes open source projects (TF-M, MCUboot, OpenThread, Matter, and the Zephyr RTOS), which are continuously integrated and redistributed with the SDK.

Release notes might refer to "experimental" support for features, which indicates that the feature is incomplete in functionality or verification, and can be expected to change in future releases.
To learn more, see :ref:`software_maturity`.

Changelog
*********

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

Protocols
=========

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`protocol <protocols>`.

Bluetooth mesh
--------------

* Fixed bugs that appeared when using extended advertiser.

Samples
=======

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`sample <sample>`, including protocol-related samples.
For lists of protocol-specific changes, see `Protocols`_.

Bluetooth samples
-----------------

* :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_light_lc` sample:

  * Removed the :c:func:`bt_disable` function call from the interrupt context before calling the :c:func:`emds_store` function.
  * Added explicit IRQ locks for RTC0, TIMER0 and RADIO peripherals used by SoftDevice Controller.

Libraries
=========
This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`library <libraries>`.

Binary libraries
----------------

* :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library:

  * Updated the glue layer to facilitate switching from NB-IoT to LTE-M during in-band FOTA.

Other libraries
---------------

* :ref:`emds_readme` library:

  * Removed the internal thread for storing the emergency data.
    The emergency data is now stored by the :c:func:`emds_store` function.
  * Updated the library implementation to bypass the flash driver when storing the emergency data.
    This allows calling the :c:func:`emds_store` function from an interrupt context.
