Changelog
*********

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

nRF5
====

The following changes are relevant for the nRF52 and nRF53 Series.

nRF52832 SoC
------------

* Removed:

  * ``esb`` subystem - Removed support for older SoC revision workarounds.

    * Removed support for nRF52832 revision 1 workarounds for Errata 102, Errata 106, and Errata 107.
    * Removed support for nRF52832 revision 2 workarounds for Errata 143.

nRF5340 SoC
-----------

* Added:

  * ``esb`` subsystem - Added support for nRF5340 (CPUNET) in the ESB subsystem.
  * ``spm`` subsystem - Added support for nRF5340 peripherals in non-secure applications.

* Updated:

  * ``bl_boot`` library - Disabled clock interrupts before booting the application.
    This change fixes an issue where the :ref:`bootloader` sample would not be able to boot a Zephyr application on the nRF5340 SoC.

Connected Home over IP (CHIP)
-----------------------------

* CHIP is now supported for development as an |NCS| submodule for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
* Added:

  * :ref:`ug_chip` protocol user guide
  * :ref:`Bolt lock <chip_lock_sample>` sample
  * :ref:`Light switch <chip_light_switch_sample>` sample
  * :ref:`Light bulb <chip_light_bulb_sample>` sample

DFU Target
----------

* Added:

  * New target ``dfu_target_full_modem`` which is used for full modem firmware updates.
    Note that this requires an external flash memory of a minimum of 2MB to work.

* Updated:

  * Renamed ``dfu_target_modem`` to ``dfu_target_modem_delta``.
  * Moved all ``dfu_target`` code up one directory from :file:`subsys/dfu` to :file:`subsys/dfu/dfu_target`.
  * Extracted the stream flash memory functionality from ``dfu_target_mcuboot`` to ``dfu_target_stream_flash`` to facilitate code re-use for other ``dfu_targets`` which write large objects to the flash memory.

HTTP Update
-----------

* Added:

  * New sample :ref:`http_modem_delta_update_sample` which shows how to add modem delta upgrade support to an application.
  * New sample :ref:`http_full_modem_update_sample` which shows how to add full modem upgrade support to an application.
    Note that this requires an external flash memory of a minimum of 2MB to work, hence the sample will only work on the nRF9160 DK version ``0.14.0`` or later.

* Updated:

  * Extracted certificate, button, and LED handling functionality from :ref:`http_application_update_sample` to :file:`samples/nrf9160/http_update/common`, to share them with :ref:`http_modem_delta_update_sample`.
  * Moved the :ref:`http_application_update_sample` sample from :file:`samples/nrf9160/http_application_update/` to :file:`samples/nrf9160/http_update/application_update`

Full modem serial update
------------------------

* Added:

  * New sample :ref:`fmfu_smp_svr_sample` which shows how to add the full modem serial update functionality to an application.
  * New module called :ref:`lib_fmfu_mgmt` which implements parts of the MCUMgr management protocol for doing full modem serial updates.

Thread
------

* Added:

  * Development support for the nRF5340 DK in single-protocol configuration for the :ref:`ot_cli_sample`, :ref:`coap_client_sample`, and :ref:`coap_server_sample` samples.
  * Development support for the nRF5340 DK in the multiprotocol configuration for the :ref:`ot_cli_sample` and :ref:`coap_client_sample` samples.

    * :ref:`lib_zigbee_logger_endpoint` library

* Updated:

  * Updated :ref:`zboss` to version ``3_3_0_6+11_30_2020``.
    See :ref:`nrfxlib:zboss_changelog` for detailed information.

Bluetooth Mesh
--------------

* Added:

  * Time client model callbacks for all message types.
  * Support for the nRF52833 DK in the :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_light` and :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_light_switch` samples.
  * Support for :ref:`bt_mesh_light_xyl_readme`.

  This follows the Mesh Model Specification section 6.2.3.

nRF9160
=======

* Added:

  * Asset Tracker v2 application for nRF9160 DK and Thingy:91, which is a low-power asset tracking example.

* Updated:

  * :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem` - BSD library has been renamed to ``nrf_modem`` (Modem library) and ``nrf_modem_lib`` (glue).
  * :ref:`lib_download_client` library:

    * Re-introduced optional TCP timeout (enabled by default) on the TCP socket used for the download.
      Upon timeout on a TCP socket, the HTTP download will fail and the ``ETIMEDOUT`` error will be returned via the callback handler.
    * Added an option to set the hostname for TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) extension.
      This option is valid only when TLS is enabled.

  * :ref:`lib_date_time` library - Added an API to check if the Date-Time library has obtained a valid date-time.
    If the function returns false, it implies that the library has not yet obtained valid date-time to base its calculations and time conversions on and hence other API calls that depend on the internal date-time will fail.

  * :ref:`serial_lte_modem` application:

    * Fixed an issue where FOTA downloads were interrupted if an AT command was issued.
    * Fixed an issue with overflowing HTTP request buffers.
    * Fixed issues with TCP/UDP server restart.
    * Added support for allowing only specified TCP/TLS client IP addresses (using the #XTCPFILTER command).
    * Fixed the unsolicited result code (URC) message format following the 3GPP TS27.007 specification.
    * Fixed a bug that occurred when the size of an AT command was exactly the maximum buffer size.
    * Optimized SRAM usage.
    * Disabled external XTAL usage for UARTE by default.
    * Added a recovery mechanism for cases where a UART frame error happens.
    * Enhanced data mode support for TCP/UDP proxy.

  * :ref:`lib_fota_download` library:

    * Enabled SNI TLS extension for HTTPS downloads.

  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:

    * AWS Jobs replaced by nRF Connect for Cloud FOTA as the FOTA mechanism for devices connected to nRF Connect for Cloud.
    * Removed :option:`CONFIG_CLOUD_API` dependency from :option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_CONNECTION_POLL_THREAD`.
    * Added a new API :c:func:`nrf_cloud_send` that can be used for sending pre-encoded data to specified endpoint topics in nRF Connect for Cloud.

  * :ref:`asset_tracker` application:

    * Updated to use the new FOTA (fota_v2) based on nRF Connect for Cloud.

  * :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library:

    * The library can now parse AT command strings with negative numbers in the range supported by the int32_t type.

  * :ref:`lwm2m_client` sample:

    * Added handling of network failures.
      The sample now tries to reconnect to the LTE network when a failure is reported.

  * :ref:`lib_azure_iot_hub` library:

    * Improved internal connection state handling.

  * :ref:`nrf_coap_client_sample` sample:

    * Updated the default server URL to ``californium.eclipseprojects.io``.

    * Updated the default server URL to ``mqtt.eclipseprojects.io``.

  * :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library:

    * Added support for manufacturer-specific default eDRX/PSM values.

Common
======

The following changes are relevant for all device families.

sdk-nrfxlib
-----------

See the changelog for each library in the :doc:`nrfxlib documentation <nrfxlib:README>` for the most current information.

Crypto
~~~~~~

* Added:

  * nrf_cc3xx_platform v0.9.5, with the following highlights:

    * Added correct TRNG characterization values for nRF5340 devices.

    See the :ref:`crypto_changelog_nrf_cc3xx_platform` for detailed information.
  * nrf_cc3xx_mbedcrypto version v0.9.5, with the following highlights:

    * Built to match the nrf_cc3xx_platform v0.9.5 including correct TRNG characterization values for nRF5340 devices.

    See the :ref:`crypto_changelog_nrf_cc3xx_mbedcrypto` for detailed information.

* Updated:

  * Rewrote the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_security`'s library stripping mechanism to not use the POST_BUILD option in a custom build rule.
    The library stripping mechanism was non-functional in certain versions of SEGGER Embedded Studio Nordic Edition.

BSD library
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added information about low accuracy mode to the :ref:`nrfxlib:gnss_extension` documentation.
* Added mutex protection for the :c:func:`nrf_getaddrinfo` function.


Trusted Firmware-M:
-------------------

* Added a simple sample that demonstrates how to integrate TF-M in an application.
* Enabled using platform code that resides outside of the Trusted Firmware-M repository.
  This allows for providing configurable memory partitioning in the nRF Connect SDK.
* Added support for running the nRF9160 Download Client sample with TF-M.

Partition Manager:
------------------

* Changed naming convention for partition names in ``pm.yml`` and ``pm_static.yml``.
* Updated Partition Manager to prevent users from using partition names in ``pm.yml`` and ``pm_static.yml`` that match the names of the child images that define them in ``CMakeLists.txt``:

  * If the invalid naming scheme is used in ``pm.yml`` files, Partition Manager will now fail the builds.
  * If the invalid naming scheme is used in ``pm_static.yml`` files, the build will instead print a warning prompting the user to change this, if possible.
* Renamed ``b0`` and ``b0n`` container partitions to ``b0_container`` and ``b0n_container``, respectively.
* Renamed ``b0_image`` and ``b0n_image`` image partitions to appropriately match their child image name, ``b0`` and ``b0n``, respectively.

  **Migration notes:** While in development, you should rename partitions appropriately.
  You can still build firmware updates under the invalid scheme, but they will still be built with the improper sizes for the related partitions.

MCUboot
=======

The MCUboot fork in |NCS| (``sdk-mcuboot``) contains all commits from the upstream MCUboot repository up to and including ``3fc59410b6``, plus some |NCS| specific additions.

Mcumgr
======

The mcumgr library contains all commits from the upstream mcumgr repository up to and including snapshot ``74e77ad08``.

The following list summarizes the most important changes inherited from upstream mcumgr:

* Fixed an issue with devices running MCUboot v1.6.0 or earlier where a power outage during erase of a corrupted image in slot 1 could result in the device not being able to boot.
  In this case, it was not possible to update the device and mcumgr would return error code 6 (``MGMT_ERR_EBADSTATE``).
* Added support for invoking shell commands (shell management) from the mcumgr command line.
* Added optional verification of an uploaded direct-xip binary, which will reject any binary that cannot boot from the base address of the offered upload slot.
  This verification can be enabled through :option:`CONFIG_IMG_MGMT_REJECT_DIRECT_XIP_MISMATCHED_SLOT`.
