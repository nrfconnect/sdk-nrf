Changelog
*********

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

nRF5
====

The following changes are relevant for the nRF52 and nRF53 Series.

nRF5340 SoC
-----------

* Updated:

  * ``bl_boot`` library - Disabled clock interrupts before booting the application.
    This change fixes an issue where the :ref:`bootloader` sample would not be able to boot a Zephyr application on the nRF5340 SoC.

Thread
------

* Added:

  * Development support for the nRF5340 DK in single-protocol configuration for the :ref:`ot_cli_sample`, :ref:`coap_client_sample`, and :ref:`coap_server_sample` samples.

* Optimized ROM and RAM used by Thread samples.
* Disabled Hardware Flow Control on the serial port in :ref:`coap_client_sample` and :ref:`coap_server_sample` samples.

Zigbee
------

* Added:

  * Development support for the nRF5340 DK in single-protocol configuration for the :ref:`zigbee_light_switch_sample`, :ref:`zigbee_light_bulb_sample`, and :ref:`zigbee_network_coordinator_sample` samples.

* Updated:

  * Updated :ref:`zboss` to version ``3_3_0_6+11_30_2020``.
    See :ref:`nrfxlib:zboss_changelog` for detailed information.

Common
======

The following changes are relevant for all device families.

sdk-nrfxlib
-----------

See the changelog for each library in the :doc:`nrfxlib documentation <nrfxlib:README>` for the most current information.

Crypto
~~~~~~

* Added:

  * nrf_cc3xx_platform v0.9.5, with the following highlights:

    * Added correct TRNG characterization values for nRF5340 devices.

    See the :ref:`crypto_changelog_nrf_cc3xx_platform` for detailed information.
  * nrf_cc3xx_mbedcrypto version v0.9.5, with the following highlights:

    * Built to match the nrf_cc3xx_platform v0.9.5 including correct TRNG characterization values for nRF5340 devices.

    See the :ref:`crypto_changelog_nrf_cc3xx_mbedcrypto` for detailed information.

* Updated:

  * Rewrote the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_security`'s library stripping mechanism to not use the POST_BUILD option in a custom build rule.
    The library stripping mechanism was non-functional in certain versions of SEGGER Embedded Studio Nordic Edition.

BSD library
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added information about low accuracy mode to the :ref:`nrfxlib:gnss_extension` documentation.

MCUboot
=======

sdk-mcuboot
-----------

The MCUboot fork in |NCS| contains all commits from the upstream MCUboot repository up to and including ``5a6e18148d``, plus some |NCS| specific additions.
The list of the most important recent changes can be found in :ref:`ncs_release_notes_140`.


Zephyr
======

sdk-zephyr
----------

.. NOTE TO MAINTAINERS: The latest Zephyr commit appears in multiple places; make sure you update them all.

The Zephyr fork in |NCS| contains all commits from the upstream Zephyr repository up to and including ``35264cc214fd``, plus some |NCS| specific additions.

For a complete list of upstream Zephyr commits incorporated into |NCS| since the most recent release, run the following command from the :file:`ncs/zephyr` repository (after running ``west update``):

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline 35264cc214fd ^v2.4.0-ncs1

For a complete list of |NCS| specific commits, run:

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline manifest-rev ^35264cc214fd

The current |NCS| release is based on Zephyr v2.4.99.

The following list summarizes the most important changes inherited from upstream Zephyr:

* Kernel:

  * Restricted thread-local storage, which is now available only when the toolchain supports it.
    Toolchain support is initially limited to the toolchains bundled with the Zephyr SDK.
  * Fixed a race condition between :c:func:`k_queue_append` and :c:func:`k_queue_alloc_append`.
  * Updated the kernel to no longer try to resume threads that are not suspended.
  * Updated the kernel to no longer attempt to queue threads that are already in the run queue.
  * Updated :c:func:`k_busy_wait` to return immediately on a zero time-out, and improved accuracy on nonzero time-outs.
  * Removed the following deprecated `kernel APIs <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-zephyr/commit/c8b94f468a94c9d8d6e6e94013aaef00b914f75b>`_:

    * ``k_enable_sys_clock_always_on()``
    * ``k_disable_sys_clock_always_on()``
    * ``k_uptime_delta_32()``
    * ``K_FIFO_INITIALIZER``
    * ``K_LIFO_INITIALIZER``
    * ``K_MBOX_INITIALIZER``
    * ``K_MEM_SLAB_INITIALIZER``
    * ``K_MSGQ_INITIALIZER``
    * ``K_MUTEX_INITIALIZER``
    * ``K_PIPE_INITIALIZER``
    * ``K_SEM_INITIALIZER``
    * ``K_STACK_INITIALIZER``
    * ``K_TIMER_INITIALIZER``
    * ``K_WORK_INITIALIZER``
    * ``K_QUEUE_INITIALIZER``

  * Removed the following deprecated `system clock APIs <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-zephyr/commit/d28f04110dcc7d1aadf1d791088af9aca467bd70>`_:

    * ``__ticks_to_ms()``
    * ``__ticks_to_us()``
    * ``sys_clock_hw_cycles_per_tick()``
    * ``z_us_to_ticks()``
    * ``SYS_CLOCK_HW_CYCLES_TO_NS64()``
    * ``SYS_CLOCK_HW_CYCLES_TO_NS()``

  * Updated :c:func:`k_timer_user_data_get` to take a ``const struct k_timer *timer`` instead of a non-\ ``const`` pointer.
