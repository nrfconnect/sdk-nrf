    * A sample to show the usage of the :ref:`at_monitor_readme` library.

* Updated:

  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:

    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_uninit`, which can be used to uninitialize the nRF Cloud library.  If :ref:`cloud_api_readme` is used, call :c:func:`cloud_uninit`
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_shadow_device_status_update`, which sets the device status in the device's shadow.
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_modem_info_json_encode`, which encodes modem information into a cJSON object formatted for use with nRF Cloud.
    * Added function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_service_info_json_encode`, which encodes service information into a cJSON object formatted for use with nRF Cloud.
    * Removed function ``nrf_cloud_sensor_attach()``, the associated structure ``nrf_cloud_sa_param``, and event ``NRF_CLOUD_EVT_SENSOR_ATTACHED``. These items provided no useful functionality.

  * :ref:`serial_lte_modem` application:

    * Added a separate document page to explain data mode mechanism and how it works.
