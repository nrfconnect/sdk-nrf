For a complete list of |NCS| specific commits, run:

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline manifest-rev ^7074254937ae

The current |NCS| release is based on Zephyr v2.5.99.

The following list summarizes the most important changes inherited from upstream Zephyr:

* Drivers:

  * Introduced the :c:macro:`DEVICE_DT_NAME` macro that returns a string name for a given devicetree node.
  * Introduced the :c:func:`device_usable_check` function that determines whether a device is ready for use.

  * Display:

    * Added a driver and a generic shield definition for Sharp memory displays of the LS0XX type.

  * Flash:

    * Implemented workaround for nRF52 anomaly 242 in the nRF SoC flash driver.
    * Added automatic selection of :option:`CONFIG_MPU_ALLOW_FLASH_WRITE` when the MPU is enabled for Arm based SoCs.

  * GPIO:

    * Used the nrfx GPIOTE channel allocator in the nRF GPIO driver to properly track GPIOTE channel allocations made in other modules.

  * IEEE 802.15.4:

    * Moved all the glue code for the nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver from the hal_nordic module to the main Zephyr repository.
    * Fixed the initialization order in the ieee802154_nrf5 driver.
    * Corrected the pool from which RX packets are allocated in the ieee802154_nrf5 driver.
    * Added blocking on the RX packet allocation in the ieee802154_nrf5 driver to avoid dropping already acknowledged frames.
    * Added the :option:`CONFIG_IEEE802154_NRF5_UICR_EUI64_ENABLE` option to allow loading EUI64 from UICR registers.

  * Sensors:

    * Reworked the BME280 sensor driver to obtain device pointers directly (used :c:macro:`DEVICE_DT_GET` instead of :c:func:`device_get_binding`).
    * Made the QDEC nrfx driver usable on nRF5340 (added required devicetree and Kconfig entries).
    * Fixed an out-of-bounds write on the stack in the DPS310 sensor driver.
    * Added multi-instance support in the IIS2DLPC sensor driver.

  * Serial:

    * Updated the nRF UARTE driver to wait for the transmitter to go idle before powering down the UARTE peripheral in asynchronous mode.
    * Fixed the power down routine in the nRF UARTE driver. Now the RX interrupt is properly disabled.
    * Clarified the meaning of the ``timeout`` parameter of the :c:func:`uart_rx_enable` API function.

  * USB:

    * Added Kconfig configuration of the stack size for the mass storage disk operations thread (:option:`CONFIG_MASS_STORAGE_STACK_SIZE`).

    * Fixed a bug where large LwM2M endpoint names were not encoded properly in the registration message.
    * Added API functions to update minimum/maximum observe period of a resource.

  * File systems:

    * Added an :c:func:`fs_file_t_init` function for initializing :c:struct:`fs_file_t` objects.
      All :c:struct:`fs_file_t` objects must now be initialized by calling this function before they can be used.
    * Added an :c:func:`fs_dir_t_init` function for initializing :c:struct:`fs_dir_t` objects.
      All :c:struct:`fs_dir_t` objects must now be initialized by calling this function before they can be used.
    * Deprecated the :option:`CONFIG_FS_LITTLEFS_FC_MEM_POOL` option and replaced it with :option:`CONFIG_FS_LITTLEFS_FC_HEAP_SIZE`.
