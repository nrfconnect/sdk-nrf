sdk-zephyr
==========

The Zephyr fork in |NCS| contains all commits from the upstream Zephyr repository up to and including ``4ef29b34e3``, plus some |NCS| specific additions.

The following list summarizes the most important changes inherited from upstream Zephyr:

* Kernel:

  * The ``CONFIG_KERNEL_DEBUG`` Kconfig option, which was used to enable ``printk()`` based debugging of the kernel internals, has been removed.
    The kernel now uses the standard Zephyr logging API at DBG log level for this purpose.
    The logging module used for the kernel is named ``os``.

* Networking:

  * LwM2M:

    * Fixed a bug where a FOTA socket was not closed after the download (PULL mode).
    * Added a Kconfig option :option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_SECONDS_TO_UPDATE_EARLY` that specifies how long before the time-out the Registration Update will be sent.
    * Added ObjLnk resource type support.

  * MQTT:

    * The ``utf8`` pointer in the :c:type:`mqtt_utf8` struct is now const.
    * The default ``clean_session`` value is now configurable with Kconfig (see :option:`CONFIG_MQTT_CLEAN_SESSION`).

  * OpenThread:

    * Updated the OpenThread revision to upstream commit e653478c503d5b13207b01938fa1fa494a8b87d3.
    * Implemented a missing ``enable`` API function for the OpenThread interface.
    * Cleaned up the OpenThread Kconfig file.
      OpenThread dependencies are now enabled automatically.
    * Allowed the application to register a callback function for OpenThread state changes.
    * Reimplemented the logger glue layer for better performance.
    * Updated the OpenThread thread priority class to be configurable.
    * Added several Kconfig options to customize the OpenThread stack.

  * Socket offloading:

    * Removed dependency to the :option:`CONFIG_NET_SOCKETS_POSIX_NAMES` configuration option.

* Bluetooth:

  * Added support for LE Advertising Extensions.
  * Added APIs for application-controlled data length and PHY updates.
  * Added legacy OOB pairing support.
  * Multiple improvements to OOB data access and pairing.
  * Deprecated ``BT_LE_SCAN_FILTER_DUPLICATE``.
    Use :cpp:enumerator:`BT_LE_SCAN_OPT_FILTER_DUPLICATE <bt_gap::BT_LE_SCAN_OPT_FILTER_DUPLICATE>` instead.
  * Deprecated ``BT_LE_SCAN_FILTER_WHITELIST``.
    Use :cpp:enumerator:`BT_LE_SCAN_OPT_FILTER_WHITELIST <bt_gap::BT_LE_SCAN_OPT_FILTER_WHITELIST>` instead.
  * Deprecated ``bt_le_scan_param::filter_dup``.
    Use ``bt_le_scan_param::options`` instead.
  * Deprecated ``bt_conn_create_le()``.
    Use :cpp:func:`bt_conn_le_create` instead.
  * Deprecated ``bt_conn_create_auto_le()``.
     Use :cpp:func:`bt_conn_le_create_auto` instead.
  * Deprecated ``bt_conn_create_slave_le()``.
    Use :cpp:func:`bt_le_adv_start` instead, with ``bt_le_adv_param::peer`` set to the remote peer's address.
  * Deprecated the ``BT_LE_ADV_*`` macros.
    Use the ``BT_GAP_ADV_*`` enums instead.

* Bluetooth LE Controller:

  * Updated the Controller to be 5.2 compliant.
  * Made PHY support configurable.
  * Updated the Controller to only use control procedures supported by the peer.
  * Added support for the nRF52820 SoC.
  * Removed the legacy Controller.

* Bluetooth Mesh:

  * Removed the ``net_idx`` parameter from the Health Client model APIs because it can be derived (by the stack) from the ``app_idx`` parameter.
