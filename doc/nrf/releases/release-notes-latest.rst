    * The library provides an API to get an attestation token from the modem.
    * Functionality requires modem firmware v1.3.0 or higher.

  * :ref:`mod_memfault` module and integration on |NCS| for nRF9160-based devices.

  * :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library:

    * Added support for %XT3412 AT command notifications, which allows the application to get prewarnings before Tracking Area Updates.
    * Added support for neighbor cell measurements.
    * Added support for %XMODEMSLEEP AT command notifications which allows the application to get notifications related to modem sleep.
    * Added support for %CONEVAL AT command that can be used to evaluate the LTE radio signal state in a cell prior to data transmission.

    * Renamed gps_agps_request() to gps_agps_request_send().

  * :ref:`aws_fota_sample` sample:

    * Removed nRF Connect for Cloud support code, because ``fota_v1`` is no longer supported in nRF Connect for Cloud.
    * Removed provisioning using :ref:`modem_key_mgmt` and :file:`certificates.h`, because this is not the recommended way of provisioning private certificates.
    * Renamed the following Kconfig options:

      * ``CONFIG_CLOUD_CERT_SEC_TAG`` renamed to :option:`CONFIG_CERT_SEC_TAG`.
