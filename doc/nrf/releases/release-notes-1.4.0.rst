  * :ref:`lib_azure_iot_hub` library - This library provides an API to connect to an Azure IoT Hub instance and interact with it.
  * :ref:`azure_iot_hub` sample - This sample demonstrates the communication of an nRF9160-based device with an Azure IoT Hub instance.
  * :ref:`azure_fota_sample` sample - This sample demonstrates how to perform an over-the-air firmware update of an nRF9160-based device using the Azure FOTA and Azure IoT Hub libraries.
  * :ref:`aws_iot` sample - This sample demonstrates the communication of an nRF9160-based device with the AWS IoT message broker over MQTT.
  * :ref:`udp` low power sample - This sample demonstrates the sequential transmission of UDP packets to a predetermined server identified by an IP address and a port.
  * :ref:`download_sample` sample - This sample demonstrates how to download files over the Internet from HTTP(S) and CoAP(S) servers.

* Updated:

  * :ref:`at_cmd_readme` library:

    * Reimplemented the library to enable asynchronous handling of commands and reduce memory usage.
    * Updated all commands to only match ``OK`` or ``ERROR`` in the response if they are at the end (in case those strings are part of the response, like in certificate).

  * BSD library:

    * Updated to version 0.8.1.
      See the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem_changelog` for detailed information.

  * :ref:`coap_utils_readme` library:

    * Added an optional ``addr`` parameter to the :c:func:`coap_init()` function.
      The parameter is meant for socket binding.

  * :ref:`connectivity_bridge` application:

    * Added automatic re-enabling of UART RX upon errors.
    * Improved the handling of configuration file.
    * Added an option to configure Bluetooth device name.

    * Removed ``port`` field in :c:struct:`download_client_cfg`.
      The port number can now be passed together with the URL.
    * Removed the ``CONFIG_DOWNLOAD_CLIENT_TLS`` Kconfig option.
      Now the choice between secure and non-secure HTTP or CoAP is determined by the schema, or by the security tag if the schema is missing.

    * Added API for setting eDRX Paging Time Window (PTW).
    * Added support for Release Assistance Indication (RAI).
    * Added :c:func:`lte_lc_deinit()` function to the API.
      This function deinitializes the LTE LC module.
    * Reworked system mode handling as follows:

      * The current mode is the mode read from the device and is changed using :c:func:`lte_lc_system_mode_set()`.
      * The target mode is the mode that is used when connecting to LTE network, that is when :c:func:`lte_lc_connect()` or  :c:func:`lte_lc_connect_async()` is called.
        The network is initialized with the configurable (and preferred) system mode.
        The mode is changed when :c:func:`lte_lc_system_mode_set()` is called or when connection establishment using preferred mode is unsuccessful and times out.

  * :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library:

    * Added the snapshot of the release version 0.10.0.

    * Added a timestamp for sensor or cloud data, or both.
    * Added the ``CONFIG_UI_LED_PWM_FREQUENCY`` Kconfig option for setting the LED PWM frequency.

* :ref:`gps_with_supl_support_sample` sample:

    * Updated the sample to allow disabling the **COEX0** pin when using the external antenna to lower noise from the LNA.
    * Updated the frequency range of the external GPS amplifier.
    * Added an option to give GPS prioritized radio access.

    * Added saving of a valid session flag to settings after all subscriptions have completed, so that the persistent session is only used when the flag is valid.
    * Replaced ``CONFIG_CLOUD_PERSISTENT_SESSIONS`` usage with Zephyr's :option:`CONFIG_MQTT_CLEAN_SESSION`.
    * Made the MQTT client ID prefix configurable.
    * Added an option to set send time-out for the socket used by nRF Cloud library (:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_SEND_TIMEOUT`).
