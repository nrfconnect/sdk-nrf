Installing the |NCS|
####################

The recommended way to get started with the |NCS| is to run the Getting Started Assistant app in nRF Connect for Desktop.
See the `Getting Started information`_ on the nRF9160 DK product page for information about how to install the Getting Started Assistant.

The Getting Started Assistant checks which of the required tools are already installed on your computer and guides you through installing the parts of the toolchain that you are missing.
In addition, it will help you clone the |NCS| repositories and set up your first project in |SES|.

.. note::
   If you use the Getting Started Assistant, you can skip this section of the documentation.
   If you prefer to install the toolchain manually, or if you run into problems during the installation process, see the following documentation for instructions.
