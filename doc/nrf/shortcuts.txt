   See :ref:`ug_thread` for more information.
.. |thread_hwfc_enabled| replace:: This sample has Hardware Flow Control mechanism enabled by default in serial communication.
   When enabled, it allows devices to manage transmission by informing each other about their current state, and ensures more reliable connection in high-speed communication scenarios.

.. |nrf_desktop_build_type_conf| replace:: In addition to these build types, some boards can have additional build type configurations that you can use to generate an application in a specific variant.
   Such board-specific configurations use dedicated :file:`app_*build_type*.conf` files, where the name of the configuration replaces the ``*build_type*`` part in the file name.
   Given the potential number of such configurations, they are not listed above and you can read the description of each of them in the respective configuration file.

.. |application_sample_definition| replace:: For simplicity, this guide will refer to both :ref:`samples<samples>` and :ref:`applications<applications>` as "applications".
.. |application_sample_long_path_windows| replace:: On Windows, because of the `Windows path length limitations`_, the build can fail with errors related to permissions or missing files if some paths in the build are too long.
   To avoid this issue, shorten the build folder name, for example, from ``build_nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp_ns`` to ``build``, or shorten the path to the build folder in some other way.

.. |gps_tradeoffs| replace:: For more information on the various trade-offs of using A-GPS compared to using P-GPS, see the `nRF Cloud Location Services documentation`_.
