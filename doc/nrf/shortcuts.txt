.. ### Other shortcuts

.. |application_sample_definition| replace:: For simplicity, this guide will refer to both :ref:`samples<samples>` and :ref:`applications<applications>` as "applications".
.. |application_sample_long_path_windows| replace:: On Windows, because of the `Windows path length limitations`_, the build can fail with errors related to permissions or missing files if some paths in the build are too long.
   To avoid this issue, shorten the build folder name, for example, from ``build_nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp_ns`` to ``build``, or shorten the path to the build folder in some other way.
