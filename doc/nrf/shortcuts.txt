.. |fota_upgrades_def| replace:: You can upgrade the firmware of the device over the air, thus without a wired connection.
   Such an upgrade is called a FOTA (firmware over-the-air) upgrade.

.. |fota_upgrades_req_mcuboot| replace:: To upgrade the application, you must use :doc:`mcuboot:index-ncs` as the upgradable bootloader (:kconfig:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT` must be enabled).

.. |fota_upgrades_building| replace:: To create a binary file for an application upgrade, make sure that :kconfig:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT` is enabled and build the application as usual.
   The build will create several binary files (see :ref:`mcuboot:mcuboot_ncs`).

   See :ref:`ug_thread` for more information.
.. |thread_hwfc_enabled| replace:: This sample has Hardware Flow Control mechanism enabled by default in serial communication.
   When enabled, it allows devices to manage transmission by informing each other about their current state, and ensures more reliable connection in high-speed communication scenarios.

.. |zigbee_version| replace:: Zigbee 3.0
.. |zboss_version| replace:: 3.9.0.1
.. |zigbee_ncp_package_version| replace:: 2.0.0

   See :ref:`ug_zigbee_configuring_libraries` for information about how to configure it for you Zigbee application.
.. |zigbee_ncp_package| replace:: It contains the full development-ready source code for host and evaluation-ready firmware for the nRF52840 DK, the nRF52833 DK, and the nRF52840 Dongle.
   The package comes with prebuilt libraries compatible with 64-bit Ubuntu 18.04 Linux.
.. |zigbee_ncp_package_more_info| replace:: For information about how to recompile the package libraries for a different host architecture or operating system, see the `NCP Host documentation`_.
   For information about how to use NCP Host for Zigbee in the |NCS| or build the firmware using the NCP sample, see the :ref:`NCP sample <zigbee_ncp_sample>`.
.. |zigbee_shell_config| replace:: You can add support for Zigbee shell commands to any of the available :ref:`Zigbee samples <zigbee_samples>`, except for the :ref:`NCP sample <zigbee_ncp_sample>`.
   Some of the commands use an endpoint for sending packets, so no endpoint handler is allowed to be registered for this endpoint.

.. |nrf_desktop_module_event_note| replace:: See the :ref:`nrf_desktop_architecture` for more information about the event-based communication in the nRF Desktop application and about how to read this table.
.. |nrf_desktop_build_type_conf| replace:: In addition to these build types, some boards can have additional build type configurations that you can use to generate an application in a specific variant.
   Such board-specific configurations use dedicated :file:`app_*build_type*.conf` files, where the name of the configuration replaces the ``*build_type*`` part in the file name.
   Given the potential number of such configurations, they are not listed above and you can read the description of each of them in the respective configuration file.

.. |how_to_configure| replace:: See :ref:`configure_application` for information on how to set the required configuration options temporarily or permanently.

.. |trusted_execution| replace:: nRF5340 and nRF9160

.. |matter_sample_button3_note| replace:: Use **Button 3** to enable this mode after building and running the sample.

.. |external_flash_size| replace:: external flash memory with minimum 4MB

.. |application_sample_definition| replace:: For simplicity, this guide will refer to both :ref:`samples<samples>` and :ref:`applications<applications>` as "applications".
.. |application_sample_long_path_windows| replace:: On Windows, because of the `Windows path length limitations`_, the build can fail with errors related to permissions or missing files if some paths in the build are too long.
   To avoid this issue, shorten the build folder name, for example, from ``build_nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp_ns`` to ``build``, or shorten the path to the build folder in some other way.

.. |gps_tradeoffs| replace:: For more information on the various trade-offs of using A-GPS compared to using P-GPS, see the `nRF Cloud Location Services documentation`_.

.. |vsc_extension_instructions| replace:: The |VSC| extension is a complete IDE for developing applications for nRF91, nRF53 and nRF52 Series devices. This includes an interface to the compiler and linker, an RTOS-aware debugger, a seamless interface to the nRF Connect SDK, and a serial terminal. For detailed instructions, see the `nRF Connect for Visual Studio Code`_ documentation site.

.. |VSC| replace:: nRF Connect for Visual Studio Code

.. |thingy53_unreleased| replace:: As of the |NCS| |release| release, Thingy:53 is an unreleased product that will be released in the near future.

.. |tfm_gnu_version_incompatibility| replace:: Do not use GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain versions *9-2020-q2-update* and *10-2020-q4-major* due to `TF-M sample incompatibility issue`_.
