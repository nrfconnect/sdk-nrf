NCSDK-6898: Setting :option:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT` does not work
  The immutable bootloader is not able to find the required metadata in the MCUboot image.
  See the related NCSDK-6898 known issue in `Build system`_ for more details.

  **Workaround:** Set :option:`CONFIG_FW_INFO` in MCUboot.

External antenna performance setting
  The preprogrammed Asset Tracker does not come with the best external antenna performance.

  **Workaround:** If you are using nRF9160 DK v0.15.0 or higher and Thingy:91 v1.4.0 or higher, set :option:`CONFIG_NRF9160_GPS_ANTENNA_EXTERNAL` to ``y``.
  Alternatively, for nRF9160 DK v0.15.0, you can set the :option:`CONFIG_NRF9160_GPS_COEX0_STRING` option to ``AT%XCOEX0`` when building the preprogrammed Asset Tracker to achieve the best external antenna performance.

NCSDK-6073: ``nrf_send`` is blocking
  The :cpp:func:`nrf_send` function in the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem` might be blocking for several minutes, even if the socket is configured for non-blocking operation.
  The behavior depends on the cellular network connection.

  **Workaround:** For |NCS| v1.4.0, set the non-blocking mode for a partial workaround for non-blocking operation.

Problems with RTT Viewer/Logger
  The SEGGER Control Block cannot be found by automatic search by the RTT Viewer/Logger.

  **Workaround:** Set the RTT Control Block address to 0 and it will try to search from address 0 and upwards.
  If this does not work, look in the ``builddir/zephyr/zephyr.map`` file to find the address of the ``_SEGGER_RTT`` symbol in the map file and use that as input to the viewer/logger.

nRF52820
========

.. rst-class:: v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

Missing :file:`CMakeLists.txt`
  The :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file for developing applications that emulate nRF52820 on the nRF52833 DK is missing.

  **Workaround:** Create a :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file in the :file:`ncs/zephyr/boards/arm/nrf52833dk_nrf52820` folder with the following content::

    zephyr_compile_definitions(DEVELOP_IN_NRF52833)
    zephyr_compile_definitions(NRFX_COREDEP_DELAY_US_LOOP_CYCLES=3)

  You can `download this file <nRF52820 CMakeLists.txt_>`_ from the upstream Zephyr repository.
  After you add it, the file is automatically included by the build system.

KRKNWK-8286: Faulty UART responsiveness in Thread NCP sample
  A race condition in the UARTE driver causes the retrieval of Spinel responses to fail sometimes for the :ref:`ot_ncp_sample` sample.

  **Workaround:** Build the sample with :option:`CONFIG_UART_0_ENHANCED_POLL_OUT` set to ``n`` or cherry-pick the upstream `Zephyr commit 2db49c`_.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-99-dev1

KRKNWK-8262: CoAP Client Sample crashes for nRF5340
  For nRF5340, the :ref:`coap_client_sample` sample crashes when changing from SED to MED mode.
  Other devices are not affected.
  The crash is caused by mode switching and IPC communication being handled by the system workqueue, which causes a deadlock.

  **Workaround:** Use the application default thread, a dedicated workqueue, or a new thread to handle operations that require radio interactions.
  If you cannot avoid using the system workqueue, cherry-pick the upstream `Zephyr commit f12536`_.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-99-dev1 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0

KRKNWK-6848: Reduced throughput
  Performance testing for :ref:`NCP sample <ot_ncp_sample>` shows a decrease of throughput of around 10-20% compared with the standard OpenThread.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-99-dev1 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0

KRKNWK-7885: Throughput is lower when using CC310 nrf_security backend
  A decrease of throughput of around 5-10% has been observed for the :ref:`CC310 nrf_security backend <nrfxlib:nrf_security_backends_cc3xx>` when compared with :ref:`nrf_oberon <nrf_security_backends_oberon>` or :ref:`the standard mbedtls backend <nrf_security_backends_orig_mbedtls>`.
  CC310 nrf_security backend is used by default for nRF52840 boards.

  **Workaround:** Use AES-CCM ciphers from the nrf_oberon backend by setting the following options:

  * :option:`CONFIG_OBERON_BACKEND` to ``y``
  * :option:`CONFIG_OBERON_MBEDTLS_AES_C` to ``y``
  * :option:`CONFIG_OBERON_MBEDTLS_CCM_C` to ``y``
  * :option:`CONFIG_CC3XX_MBEDTLS_AES_C` to ``n``

.. rst-class:: v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0

KRKNWK-7721: MAC counter updating issue
  The ``RxDestAddrFiltered`` MAC counter is not being updated.
  This is because the ``PENDING_EVENT_RX_FAILED`` event is not implemented in Zephyr.

  **Workaround:** To fix the error, cherry-pick commits from the upstream `Zephyr PR #29226 <https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/29226>`_.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-99-dev1 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0

KRKNWK-7962: Logging interferes with shell output
  :option:`CONFIG_LOG_MINIMAL` is configured by default for most OpenThread samples.
  It accesses the UART independently from the shell backend, which sometimes leads to malformed output.

  **Workaround:** Disable logging or enable a more advanced logging option.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-99-dev1 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0

KRKNWK-7803: Automatically generated libraries are missing otPlatLog for NCP
  When building OpenThread libraries using a different sample than the :ref:`Thread NCP sample <ot_ncp_sample>`, the :file:`ncp_base.cpp` is not compiled with the :c:func:`otPlatLog` function.
  This results in a linking failure when building the NCP with these libraries.

  **Workaround:** Use the :ref:`Thread NCP sample <ot_ncp_sample>` to create OpenThread libraries.

.. rst-class:: v1-3-1 v1-3-0

NCSDK-5014: Building with SES not possible
  It is not possible to build Thread samples using SEGGER Embedded Studio (SES).
  SES does not support :file:`.cpp` files in |NCS| projects.

.. rst-class:: v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

KRKNWK-6358: CoAP client sample provisioning issues
  It is not possible to provision the :ref:`coap_client_sample` sample to servers that it cannot directly communicate with.
  This is because Link Local Address is used for communication.

.. rst-class:: v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

KRKNWK-6408: ``diag`` command not supported
  The ``diag`` command is not yet supported by Thread in the |NCS|.

  Executing a high number of ZDO commands can cause assert on the coordinator with the :ref:`lib_zigbee_shell` component enabled.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0

KRKNWK-7831: Factory reset broken on coordinator with Zigbee shell
  A coordinator with the :ref:`lib_zigbee_shell` component enabled could assert after executing the ``bdb factory_reset`` command.

  **Workaround:** Call the ``bdb_reset_via_local_action`` function twice to remove all the network information.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-99-dev1 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0

KRKNWK-7723: OTA upgrade process restarting after client reset
  After the reset of OTA Upgrade Client, the client will start the OTA upgrade process from the beginning instead of continuing the previous process.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-99-dev1 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

KRKNWK-6318: Device assert after multiple Leave requests

.. rst-class:: v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

KRKNWK-6071: ZBOSS alarms inaccurate
  On average, ZBOSS alarms last longer by 6.4 percent than Zephyr alarms.

  **Workaround:** Use Zephyr alarms.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-99-dev1 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

KRKNWK-5535: Device assert if flooded with multiple Network Address requests
  The device could assert if it receives Network Address requests every 0.2 second or more frequently.

.. rst-class:: v1-3-1 v1-3-0

KRKNWK-6073: Potential delay during FOTA
  There might be a noticeable delay (~220 ms) between calling the ZBOSS API and on-the-air activity.

nRF Desktop
===========

.. rst-class:: v1-4-99-dev1 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

DESK-978: Directed advertising issues with SoftDevice Link Layer
  Directed advertising (:option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_DIRECT_ADV`) should not be used by the :ref:`nrf_desktop` application when the :ref:`nrfxlib:softdevice_controller` is in use, because that leads to reconnection problems.
  For more detailed information, see the ``Known issues and limitations`` section of the SoftDevice Controller's :ref:`nrfxlib:softdevice_controller_changelog`.

  **Workaround:** Directed advertising is disabled by default for nRF Desktop.

NCSDK-6845: Pairing failure with simultaneous pairing on multiple connections
  When using LE Secure Connections pairing, the pairing fails with simultaneous pairing on multiple connections.
  The failure reason is unspecified.

  **Workaround:** Retry the pairing on the connections that failed one by one after the pairing procedure has finished.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-99-dev1 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

NCSDK-6844: Security procedure failure can terminate GATT client request
  A security procedure terminates the GATT client request that is currently in progress, unless the request was the reason to initiate the security procedure.
  If a new GATT client request is queued at this time, this might potentially cause a GATT transaction violation and fail as well.

  **Workaround:** Do not initiate a security procedure in parallel with GATT client requests.

.. rst-class:: v1-3-0

NCSDK-5711: High-throughput transmission can deadlock the receive thread
  High-throughput transmission can deadlock the receive thread if the connection is suddenly disconnected.

.. rst-class:: v1-2-1 v1-2-0

Only secure applications can use Bluetooth LE
  Bluetooth LE cannot be used in a non-secure application, for example, an application built for the ``nrf5340_dk_nrf5340_cpuappns`` build target.

  **Workaround:** Use the ``nrf5340_dk_nrf5340_cpuapp`` build target instead.

.. rst-class:: v1-2-1 v1-2-0

Peripheral HIDS keyboard sample cannot be used with nRF Bluetooth LE Controller
  The :ref:`peripheral_hids_keyboard` sample cannot be used with the :ref:`nrfxlib:softdevice_controller` because the NFC subsystem does not work with the controller library.
  The library uses the MPSL Clock driver, which does not provide an API for asynchronous clock operation.
  NFC requires this API to work correctly.

.. rst-class:: v1-2-1 v1-2-0

Peripheral HIDS mouse sample advertising issues
  When the :ref:`peripheral_hids_mouse` sample is used with the Zephyr Bluetooth LE Controller, directed advertising does not time out and the regular advertising cannot be started.

.. rst-class:: v1-2-1 v1-2-0

Central HIDS sample issues with directed advertising
  The :ref:`bluetooth_central_hids` sample cannot connect to a peripheral that uses directed advertising.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0

Unstable samples
  Bluetooth Low Energy peripheral samples are unstable in some conditions (when pairing and bonding are performed and then disconnections/re-connections happen).

.. rst-class:: v1-2-1 v1-2-0 v1-1-0

:option:`CONFIG_BT_SMP` alignment requirement
  When running the :ref:`bluetooth_central_dfu_smp` sample, the :option:`CONFIG_BT_SMP` configuration must be aligned between this sample and the Zephyr counterpart (:ref:`zephyr:smp_svr_sample`).
  However, security is not enabled by default in the Zephyr sample.

.. rst-class:: v1-2-1 v1-2-0 v1-1-0 v1-0-0

Reconnection issues on some operating systems
  On some operating systems, the :ref:`nrf_desktop` application is unable to reconnect to a host.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0 v1-0-0

:ref:`central_uart` cannot handle long strings
  A too long 212-byte string cannot be handled when entered to the console to send to :ref:`peripheral_uart`.

.. rst-class:: v1-0-0

:ref:`bluetooth_central_hids` loses UART connectivity
  After programming a HEX file to the nrf52_pca10040 board, UART connectivity is lost when using the BLE Controller.
  The board must be reset to get UART output.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0 v1-0-0

Samples crashing on nRF51 when using GPIO
  On nRF51 devices, Bluetooth LE samples that use GPIO might crash when buttons are pressed frequently.
  In such case, the GPIO ISR introduces latency that violates real-time requirements of the Radio ISR.
  nRF51 is more sensitive to this issue than nRF52 (faster core).

.. rst-class:: v0-4-0

GATT Discovery Manager missing support
  The :ref:`gatt_dm_readme` is not supported on nRF51 devices.

Peripheral UART string size issue
  :ref:`peripheral_uart` cannot handle the corner case that a user attempts to send a string of more than 211 bytes.

.. rst-class:: v0-3-0

Reconnection issues after bonding
  The peripheral samples (:ref:`peripheral_uart`, :ref:`peripheral_lbs`, :ref:`peripheral_hids_mouse`) have reconnection issues after performing bonding (LE Secure Connection pairing enable) with nRF Connect for Desktop.
  These issues result in disconnection.

Bluetooth mesh

NCSDK-5580: nRF5340 only supports SoftDevice Controller
  On nRF5340, only the :ref:`nrfxlib:softdevice_controller` is supported for Bluetooth mesh.

Bootloader
==========

.. rst-class:: v1-4-99-dev1

NCSDK-7173: nRF5340 network core bootloader cannot be built stand-alone
  The :ref:`nc_bootloader` sample does not compile when built stand-alone.
  It compiles without problems when included as a child image.

  **Workaround:** Include the :ref:`nc_bootloader` sample as child image instead of compiling it stand-alone.

NCSDK-6777: Project out of date when :option:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT` is set
  The DFU :file:`.zip` file is regenerated even when no changes are made to the files it depends on.
  As a consequence, SES displays a "Project out of date" message even when the project is not out of date.

  **Workaround:** Apply the fix from `sdk-nrf PR #3241 <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/pull/3241>`_.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-99-dev1 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0

NCSDK-6848: MCUboot must be built from source when included
  The build will fail if either :option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_BUILD_STRATEGY_SKIP_BUILD` or :option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_BUILD_STRATEGY_USE_HEX_FILE` is set.

  **Workaround:** Set :option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_BUILD_STRATEGY_FROM_SOURCE` instead.

KRKNWK-7827: Application build system is not aware of the settings partition
  The application build system is not aware of partitions, including the settings partition, which can result in application code overlapping with other partitions.
  As a consequence, writing to overlapping partitions might remove or damage parts of the firmware, which can lead to errors that are difficult to debug.

  **Workaround:** Define and use a code partition to shrink the effective flash memory available for the application.
  You can use one of the following solutions:

  * :ref:`partition_manager` from |NCS| - see the page for all configuration options.
    For example, for single image (without bootloader and with the settings partition used), set the :option:`CONFIG_PM_SINGLE_IMAGE` Kconfig option to ``y`` and define the value for :option:`CONFIG_PM_PARTITION_SIZE_SETTINGS_STORAGE` to the required settings storage size.
  * :ref:`Devicetree code partition <zephyr:flash_map_api>` from Zephyr.
    Set :option:`CONFIG_USE_DT_CODE_PARTITION` Kconfig option to ``y``.
    Make sure that the code partition is defined and chosen correctly (``offset`` and ``size``).

.. rst-class:: v1-4-99-dev1 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

Build configuration issues
  The build configuration consisting of :ref:`bootloader`, :ref:`secure_partition_manager`, and application does not work.

  **Workaround:** Either include MCUboot in the build or use MCUboot instead of the immutable bootloader.

.. rst-class:: v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

Flash commands only program one core
  ``west flash`` and ``ninja flash`` only program one core, even if multiple cores are included in the build.

  **Workaround:** Execute the flash command from inside the build directory of the child image that is placed on the other core (for example, :file:`build/hci_rpmsg`).

  When using the :ref:`lib_download_client` library with HTTP (without TLS), the application might not process incoming fragments fast enough, which can starve the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem` buffers and make calls to the Modem library hang.
  Samples and applications that are affected include those that use :ref:`lib_download_client` to download files through HTTP, or those that use :ref:`lib_fota_download` with modem updates enabled.

  **Workaround:** Set :option:`CONFIG_DOWNLOAD_CLIENT_RANGE_REQUESTS`.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0

Jobs not received after reset
  When using :ref:`lib_aws_fota`, no new jobs are received on the device if the device is reset during a firmware upgrade or loses the MQTT connection.

  **Workaround:** Delete the stalled in progress job from AWS IoT.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0

Stalled download
  :ref:`lib_fota_download` does not resume a download if the device loses the connection.

  **Workaround:** Call :cpp:func:`fota_download_start` again with the same arguments when the connection is re-established to resume the download.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0

Offset not retained with an MCUboot target
  When using the MCUboot target in :ref:`lib_dfu_target`, the write/downloaded offset is not retained when the device is reset.

Download stopped on socket connection time-out
  In the :ref:`aws_fota_sample` and :ref:`http_application_update_sample` samples, the download is stopped if the socket connection times out before the modem can delete the modem firmware.
  A fix for this issue is available in commit `38625ba7 <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/commit/38625ba775adda3cdc7dbf516eeb3943c7403227>`_.

  **Workaround:** Call :cpp:func:`fota_download_start` again with the same arguments.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0

Update event triggered by an error event
  If the last fragment of a :ref:`lib_fota_download` is received but is corrupted, or if the last write is unsuccessful, the library emits an error event as expected.
  However, it also emits an apply/request update event, even though the downloaded data is invalid.

FW upgrade is broken for multi-image builds
  Firmware upgrade using mcumgr or USB DFU is broken for multi-image builds, because the devicetree configuration is not used.
  Therefore, it is not possible to upload the image.

Several issues for nRF5340
  The following issues can occur when using SoftDevice Controller with nRF5340:

  * Poor performance when performing active scanning.
  * The controller could assert when receiving extended advertising packets.
  * The ``T_IFS`` could in certain conditions be off by 5 us.
  * The radio could stay in the TX state longer than expected.
    This issue can only occur when sending a packet on either LE 1M or LE 2M PHY after receiving or transmitting a packet on LE Coded PHY.
    If this occurs while performing a Link Layer Control Procedure, the controller could end up retransmitting an acknowledged packet, resulting in a disconnect.
