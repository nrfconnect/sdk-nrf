External antenna performance setting
  The preprogrammed Asset Tracker does not come with the best external antenna performance.

  **Workaround:** If you are using nRF9160 DK v0.15.0 or higher and Thingy:91 v1.4.0 or higher, set :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF9160_GPS_ANTENNA_EXTERNAL` to ``y``.
  Alternatively, for nRF9160 DK v0.15.0, you can set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF9160_GPS_COEX0_STRING` option to ``AT%XCOEX0`` when building the preprogrammed Asset Tracker to achieve the best external antenna performance.

CIA-463: Wrong network mode parameter reported to cloud
  The network mode string present in ``deviceInfo`` (nRF Cloud) and ``dev`` (Azure IoT Hub and AWS IoT) JSON objects that is reported to cloud might contain wrong network modes.
  The network mode string contains the network modes that the modem is configured to use, not what the modem actually connects to the LTE network with.

CIA-604: ATv2 cannot be built for the ``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` build target with ``SECURE_BOOT`` enabled
  Due to the use of static partitions with the Thingy:91, there is insufficient room in the flash memory to enable both the primary and secondary bootloaders.

.. rst-class:: v2-0-2 v2-0-1 v2-0-0

CIA-661: Asset Tracker v2 application configured for LwM2M cannot be built for the ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns`` build target with modem traces or memfault enabled
  The :ref:`asset_tracker_v2` application configured for LwM2M cannot be built for the ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns`` build target with :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE` for modem traces or ``overlay-memfault.conf`` for memfault due to memory constraints.

  **Workaround**

  Use one of the following workarounds for modem traces:

  * Use :ref:`secure_partition_manager` instead of TF-M by setting :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SPM` to ``y`` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BUILD_WITH_TFM` to ``n``.
  * Reduce the value of :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_SHMEM_TRACE_SIZE` to 8 Kb, however, this might lead to loss of modem traces.

  For memfault, use :ref:`secure_partition_manager` instead of TF-M by setting :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SPM` to ``y`` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BUILD_WITH_TFM` to ``n``.

NCSDK-15512: Modem traces retrieval incompatible with TF-M
  Enabling modem traces with :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_UART NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE_BACKEND_UART` set to ``y`` will disable TF-M logging from secure processing environment (using :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_LOG_LEVEL_SILENCE` set to ``y``) including output from hardware fault handlers.
  You can either use **UART1** for TF-M output or for modem traces, but not for both.

NCSDK-15471: Compilation with SUPL client library fails when TF-M is enabled
  Building an application that uses the SUPL client library fails if TF-M is used.

  **Workaround:** Use one of the following workarounds:

  * Use :ref:`secure_partition_manager` instead of TF-M.
  * Disable the FPU by setting :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FPU` to ``n``.

CIA-351: Connectivity issues with Azure IoT Hub
  If a ``device-bound`` message is sent to the device while it is in the LTE Power Saving Mode (PSM), the TCP connection will most likely be terminated by the server.
  Known symptoms of this are frequent reconnections to cloud, messages sent to Azure IoT Hub never arriving, and FOTA images being downloaded twice.

  **Workaround:** Avoid using LTE Power Saving Mode (PSM) and extended DRX intervals longer than approximately 30 seconds. This will reduce the risk of the issue occurring, at the cost of increased power consumption.

NCSDK-10106: Elevated current consumption when using applications without :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem` on nRF9160
  When running applications that do not enable :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem` on nRF9160 with build code B1A, current consumption will stay at 3 mA when in sleep.

  **Workaround:** Enable :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem`.

NCSDK-8075: Invalid initialization of ``mbedtls_entropy_context`` mutex type
  The calls to :cpp:func:`mbedtls_entropy_init` do not zero-initialize the member variable ``mutex`` when ``nrf_cc3xx`` is enabled.

  **Workaround:** Zero-initialize the structure type before using it or make it a static variable to ensure that it is zero-initialized.

NCSDK-12912: LwM2M carrier library does not recover if initial network connection fails
  When the device is switched on, if :cpp:func:`lte_lc_connect()` returns an error at timeout, it will cause :cpp:func:`lwm2m_carrier_init()` to fail.
  Thus, the device will fail to connect to carrier device management servers.

  **Workaround:** Increase :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_NETWORK_TIMEOUT` to allow :ref:`lte_lc_readme` more time to successfully connect.

.. rst-class:: v1-7-1 v1-7-0 v1-6-1 v1-6-0 v1-5-1 v1-5-0 v1-4-2 v1-3-1 v1-2-1 v1-2-0

NCSDK-12913: LwM2M carrier library will fail to initialize if phone number is not present in SIM
  The SIM phone number is needed during the :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library start-up.
  For new SIM cards, it might take some time before the phone number is received by the network.
  The LwM2M carrier library does not wait for this to happen.
  Thus, the device can fail to connect to the carrier's device management servers.

  **Workaround:** Use one of the following workarounds:

  * Reboot or power-cycle the device after the SIM has received a phone number from the network.
  * Apply the following commits, depending on your |NCS| version:

    * `v1.7-branch <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/pull/6287>`_
    * `v1.6-branch <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/pull/6286>`_
    * `v1.4-branch <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/pull/6270>`_

NCSDK-13106: When replacing a Verizon SIM card, the LwM2M carrier library does not reconnect to the device management servers
  When a Verizon SIM card is replaced with a new Verizon SIM card, the library fails to fetch the correct PSK for the bootstrap server.
  Thus, the device fails to connect to the carrier's device management servers.

  **Workaround:** Use one of the following workarounds:

  * Use the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_CARRIER_USE_CUSTOM_PSK` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_CARRIER_CUSTOM_PSK` configuration options to set the appropriate PSK needed for Verizon test or live servers.
    This PSK can be obtain from the carrier.
  * After inserting a new SIM card, reboot the device again.

NCSDK-11684: Failure loading KMU registers on nRF9160 devices
  Certain builds will experience problems loading HUK to KMU due to a bug in nrf_cc3xx_platform library prior to version 0.9.12.
  The problem arises in certain builds depending on alignment of code.
  The reason for the issue is improper handling of PAN 7 on nRF9160 devices.

  **Workaround:** Update to nrf_cc3xx_platform/nrf_cc3xx_mbedcrypto v0.9.12 or newer versions if KMU is needed.

NCSDK-7856: Faulty indirection on ``nrf_cc3xx`` memory slab when freeing the platform mutex
  The :cpp:func:`mutex_free_platform` function has a bug where a call to :cpp:func:`k_mem_slab_free` provides wrong indirection on a parameter to free the platform mutex.

  **Workaround:** Write the call to free the mutex in the following way: ``k_mem_slab_free(&mutex_slab, &mutex->mutex)``.
  The change adds ``&`` before the parameter ``mutex->mutex``.

NCSDK-7914: The ``nrf_cc3xx`` RSA implementation does not deduce missing parameters
  The calls to :cpp:func:`mbedtls_rsa_complete` will not deduce all types of missing RSA parameters when using ``nrf_cc3xx`` v0.9.6 or earlier.

  **Workaround:** Calculate the missing parameters outside of this function or update to ``nrf_cc3xx`` v0.9.7 or later.

NCSDK-6073: ``nrf_send`` is blocking
  The :cpp:func:`nrf_send` function in the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem` might be blocking for several minutes, even if the socket is configured for non-blocking operation.
  The behavior depends on the cellular network connection.

  **Workaround:** For |NCS| v1.4.0, set the non-blocking mode for a partial workaround for non-blocking operation.

Problems with RTT Viewer/Logger
  The SEGGER Control Block cannot be found by automatic search by the RTT Viewer/Logger.

  **Workaround:** Set the RTT Control Block address to 0 and it will try to search from address 0 and upwards.
  If this does not work, look in the :file:`builddir/zephyr/zephyr.map` file to find the address of the ``_SEGGER_RTT`` symbol in the map file and use that as input to the viewer/logger.

LTE Sensor Gateway fails to run
  The :ref:`lte_sensor_gateway` sample system faults when the board version is not included with the build target while building the sample.
  This is due to an issue with the low-power UART and HCI drivers.

  **Workaround:** Include the board version when building the :ref:`bluetooth-hci-lpuart-sample` sample and the :ref:`lte_sensor_gateway` sample.
  For example, for board version 1.1.0, the samples must be built in the following way:

  The :ref:`bluetooth-hci-lpuart-sample` sample:

  .. parsed-literal::
    :class: highlight

    west build --board nrf9160dk_nrf52840_ns@1.1.0

NCSDK-18376: P-GPS in external flash fails to inject first prediction during load sequence
  When using external flash with P-GPS, stored predictions cannot be reliably read to satisfy the modem's need for ephemeris data when actively downloading and storing predictions to the same external flash.
  Once the download is complete, the predictions can be reliably read.

NCSDK-9786: Wrong FLASH_PAGE_ERASE_MAX_TIME_US for the nRF53 network core
  ``FLASH_PAGE_ERASE_MAX_TIME_US`` defines the execution window duration when doing the flash operation synchronously along the radio operations (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_PARTIAL_ERASE` not enabled).

  The ``FLASH_PAGE_ERASE_MAX_TIME_US`` value of the nRF53 network core is lower than required.
  For this reason, if :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_RADIO_SYNC_MPSL` is set to ``y`` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_PARTIAL_ERASE` is set to ``n``, a flash erase operation on the nRF5340 network core will result in an MPSL timeslot OVERSTAYED assert.

  **Workaround:** Increase ``FLASH_PAGE_ERASE_MAX_TIME_US`` (defined in :file:`ncs/zephyr/soc/arm/nordic_nrf/nrf53/soc.h`) from 44850UL to 89700UL (the same value as for the application core).

.. rst-class:: v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

Missing :file:`CMakeLists.txt`
  The :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file for developing applications that emulate nRF52820 on the nRF52833 DK is missing.

  **Workaround:** Create a :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file in the :file:`ncs/zephyr/boards/arm/nrf52833dk_nrf52820` folder with the following content::

    zephyr_compile_definitions(DEVELOP_IN_NRF52833)
    zephyr_compile_definitions(NRFX_COREDEP_DELAY_US_LOOP_CYCLES=3)

  You can `download this file <nRF52820 CMakeLists.txt_>`_ from the upstream Zephyr repository.
  After you add it, the file is automatically included by the build system.

KRKNWK-7885: Throughput is lower when using CC310 nrf_security backend
  A decrease of throughput of around 5-10% has been observed for the :ref:`CC310 nrf_security backend <nrfxlib:nrf_security_backends_cc3xx>` when compared with :ref:`nrf_oberon <nrf_security_backends_oberon>` or :ref:`the standard mbedtls backend <nrf_security_backends_orig_mbedtls>`.
  CC310 nrf_security backend is used by default for nRF52840 boards.
  The source of throughput decrease is coupled to the cost of RTOS mutex locking when using the :ref:`CC310 nrf_security backend <nrfxlib:nrf_security_backends_cc3xx>` when the APIs are called with shorter inputs.

  **Workaround:** Use AES-CCM ciphers from the nrf_oberon backend by setting the following options:

  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_OBERON_BACKEND` to ``y``
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_OBERON_MBEDTLS_AES_C` to ``y``

KRKNWK-12115: Simultaneous commissioning of many devices can cause the Coordinator device to assert
  The Zigbee Coordinator device can assert when multiple devices are being commissioned simultaneously.
  In some cases, the device can end up in the low memory state as the result.

  **Workaround:** To lower the likelihood of the Coordinator device asserting, increase its scheduler queue and buffer pool by completing the following steps:

  1. Create your own custom memory configuration file by creating an empty header file for your application, similar to :file:`include/zb_mem_config_custom.h` header file in the :ref:`Zigbee light switch <zigbee_light_switch_sample>` sample.
  #. Copy the contents of :file:`zb_mem_config_max.h` memory configuration file to the memory configuration header file you have just created.
     The Zigbee Network Coordinator sample uses the contents of the memory configuration file by default.
  #. In your custom memory configuration file, locate the following code:

     .. code-block:: c

        /* Now if you REALLY know what you do, you can study zb_mem_config_common.h and redefine some configuration parameters, like:
        #undef ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE
        #define ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE 56
        */

  #. Replace the code you have just located with the following code:

     .. code-block:: c

        /* Increase Scheduler queue size. */
        undef ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE
        define ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE XYZ
        /* Increase buffer pool size. */
        undef ZB_CONFIG_IOBUF_POOL_SIZE
        define ZB_CONFIG_IOBUF_POOL_SIZE XYZ

  #. To increase the scheduler queue size, replace ``XYZ`` next to ``ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE`` with the value of your choice, ranging from ``48U`` to ``256U``.
  #. To increase the buffer pool size, replace ``XYZ`` next to ``ZB_CONFIG_IOBUF_POOL_SIZE`` with the value of your choice, ranging from ``48U`` to ``127U``.

KRKNWK-12017: Zigbee End Device does not recover from broken rejoin procedure
  If the Device Announcement packet is not acknowledged by the End Device's parent, joiner logic is stopped and the device does not recover.

  **Workaround:** Complete the following steps to detect when the rejoin procedure breaks and reset the device:

  1. Introduce helper variable ``joining_signal_received``.
  #. Extend ``zigbee_default_signal_handler()`` by completing the following steps:

     a. Set ``joining_signal_received`` to ``true`` in the following signals: ``ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_DEVICE_FIRST_START``, ``ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_DEVICE_REBOOT``, ``ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_STEERING``.
     #. If ``leave_type`` is set to ``ZB_NWK_LEAVE_TYPE_REJOIN``, set ``joining_signal_received`` to ``false`` in the ``ZB_ZDO_SIGNAL_LEAVE`` signal.
     #. Handle the ``ZB_NLME_STATUS_INDICATION`` signal to detect when End Device failed to transmit packet to its parent, reported by signal's status ``ZB_NWK_COMMAND_STATUS_PARENT_LINK_FAILURE``.

  See the following snippet for an example:

  .. code-block:: c

     /* Add helper variable that will be used for detecting broken rejoin procedure. */
     /* Flag indicating if joining signal has been received since restart or leave with rejoin. */

DRGN-15448: Incomplete bond overwrite during pairing procedure when peer is not using the IRK stored in the bond
  When pairing with a peer that has deleted its bond information and is using a new IRK to establish the connection, the existing bond is not overwritten during the pairing procedure.
  This can lead to MIC errors during reconnection if the old LTK is used instead.

NCSDK-8321: NUS shell transport sample does not display the initial shell prompt
  NUS shell transport sample does not display the initial shell prompt ``uart:~$`` on the remote terminal.
  Also, few logs with sending errors are displayed on the terminal connected directly to the DK.
  This issue is caused by the shell being enabled before turning on the notifications for the NUS service by the remote peer.

  **Workaround:** Enable the shell after turning on the NUS notifications or block it until turning on the notifications.

NCSDK-8224: Callbacks for "security changed" and "pairing failed" are not always called
  The pairing failed and security changed callbacks are not called when the connection is disconnected during the pairing procedure or the required security is not met.

  **Workaround:** Application should use the disconnected callback to handle pairing failed.

NCSDK-8223: GATT requests might deadlock RX thread
  GATT requests might deadlock the RX thread when all TX buffers are taken by GATT requests and the RX thread tries to allocate a TX buffer for a response.
  This causes a deadlock because only the RX thread releases the TX buffers for the GATT requests.
  The deadlock is resolved by a 30 second timeout, but the ATT bearer cannot transmit without reconnecting.

  **Workaround:** Set :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_L2CAP_TX_BUF_COUNT` >= ``CONFIG_BT_ATT_TX_MAX`` + 2.

NCSDK-6845: Pairing failure with simultaneous pairing on multiple connections
  When using LE Secure Connections pairing, the pairing fails with simultaneous pairing on multiple connections.
  The failure reason is unspecified.

  **Workaround:** Retry the pairing on the connections that failed one by one after the pairing procedure has finished.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

NCSDK-6844: Security procedure failure can terminate GATT client request
  A security procedure terminates the GATT client request that is currently in progress, unless the request was the reason to initiate the security procedure.
  If a new GATT client request is queued at this time, this might potentially cause a GATT transaction violation and fail as well.

  **Workaround:** Do not initiate a security procedure in parallel with GATT client requests.

KRKNWK-7827: Application build system is not aware of the settings partition
  The application build system is not aware of partitions, including the settings partition, which can result in application code overlapping with other partitions.
  As a consequence, writing to overlapping partitions might remove or damage parts of the firmware, which can lead to errors that are difficult to debug.

  **Workaround:** Define and use a code partition to shrink the effective flash memory available for the application.
  You can use one of the following solutions:

  * :ref:`partition_manager` from |NCS| - see the page for all configuration options.
    For example, for single image (without bootloader and with the settings partition used), set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_SINGLE_IMAGE` Kconfig option to ``y`` and define the value for :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_PARTITION_SIZE_SETTINGS_STORAGE` to the required settings storage size.
  * :ref:`Devicetree code partition <zephyr:flash_map_api>` from Zephyr.
    Set :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USE_DT_CODE_PARTITION` Kconfig option to ``y``.
    Make sure that the code partition is defined and chosen correctly (``offset`` and ``size``).

NCSDK-7982: Partition manager: Incorrect partition size linkage from name conflict
  The partition manager will incorrectly link a partition's size to the size of its container if the container partition's name matches its child image's name in :file:`CMakeLists.txt`.
  This can cause the inappropriately-sized partition to overwrite another partition beyond its intended boundary.

  **Workaround:** Rename the container partitions in the :file:`pm.yml` and :file:`pm_static.yml` files to something that does not match the child images' names, and rename the child images' main image partition to its name in :file:`CMakeLists.txt`.

NCSDK-11308: Powering off device immediately after serial recovery of the nRF53 network core firmware results in broken firmware
  The network core will not be able to boot if the device is powered off too soon after completing a serial recovery update procedure of the network core firmware.
  This is because the firmware is being copied from shared RAM to network core flash **after** mcumgr indicates that the serial recovery procedure has completed.

  **Workaround:** Use one of the following workarounds:

  * Wait for 30 seconds before powering off the device after performing serial recovery of the nRF53 network core firmware.
  * Re-upload the network core firmware with a new serial recovery procedure if the device was powered off too soon in a previous procedure.

DRGN-15531: The coding scheme provided by the LE Set PHY HCI Command is ignored after a remote initiated PHY procedure
  The PHY options set by the host in LE Set PHY command are reverted when the remote initiates a PHY update.
  This happens because of the automatic reply of a PHY update Request in the SoftDevice Controller.
  This makes it impossible to change the PHY preferred coding in both directions.
  When receiving on S2, the SoftDevice Controller will always transmit on S8 even when configured to prefer S2.

DRGN-15465: Corrupted advertising data when :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_EXT_ADV` is set
  Setting scan response data for a legacy advertiser on a build with extended advertising support corrupts parts of the advertising data.
  When using ``BT_LE_ADV_OPT_USE_NAME`` (which is the default configuration in most samples), the device name is put in the scan response.
  This corrupts the advertising data.

  **Workaround:** Do not set scan response data.
  That implies not using the ``BT_LE_ADV_OPT_USE_NAME`` option, or the :c:macro:`BT_LE_ADV_CONN_NAME` macro when initializing Bluetooth.
  Instead, use :c:macro:`BT_LE_ADV_CONN`, and if necessary set the device name in the advertising data manually.

  **Workaround:** Place the ``rpmsg_nrf53_sram`` partition inside the ``sram_nonsecure`` partition using :ref:`partition_manager`.

NCSIDB-840: Compilation of I2C TWIM driver fails when PINCTRL is disabled
  The I2C driver for TWIM peripherals (:file:`i2c_nrfx_twim.c`) cannot be compiled with :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PINCTRL` set to ``n``.

  **Workaround:** Wrap the call to ``pinctrl_apply_state()`` on line 292 of :file:`i2c_nrfx_twim.c` in a ``#ifdef CONFIG_PINCTRL`` block.
  Additionally, when :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_DEVICE` is set to ``y``, ``#ifdef CONFIG_PINCTRL`` from line 307 and the corresponding ``#endif`` need to be removed.

The time returned by clock_gettime() API becomes incorrect after one week of uptime
  The time returned by POSIX clock_gettime() API becomes incorrect after one week elapses.
  This is due to an overflow in the uptime conversion.

NCSIDB-108: Thread context switch might lead to a kernel fault
  If the Zephyr kernel preempts the current thread and performs a context switch to a new thread while the current thread is executing a secure service, the behavior is undefined and might lead to a kernel fault.
  To prevent this situation, a thread that aims to call a secure service must temporarily lock the kernel scheduler (:cpp:func:`k_sched_lock`) and unlock the scheduler (:cpp:func:`k_sched_unlock`) after returning from the secure call.

NCSDK-6852: Extra CMake options might not be applied in version 5.10d
  If you specify :guilabel:`Extra CMake Build Options` in the **Open nRF Connect SDK Project** dialog and at the same time select an **nRF Connect Toolchain Version** of the form ``X.Y.Z``, the additional CMake options are discarded.

  **Workaround:** Select ``NONE (Use SES settings/environment PATH)`` from the :guilabel:`nRF Connect Toolchain Version` drop-down if you want to specify :guilabel:`Extra CMake Build Options`.

NCSDK-8372: Project name collision causes SES Nordic Edition to load the wrong project
  Some samples that are located in different folders use the same project name.
  For example, there is a ``light_switch`` project both in the :file:`samples/bluetooth/mesh/` folder and in the :file:`samples/zigbee/` folder.
  When you select one of these samples from the project list in the **Open nRF Connect SDK Project** dialog, the wrong sample might be selected.
  Check the **Build Directory** field in the dialog to see if this is the case.
  The field indicates the path to the project that SES Nordic Edition will load.

  **Workaround:** If the path in **Build Directory** points to the wrong project, select the correct project by using the :guilabel:`...` button for :guilabel:`Projects` and navigating to the correct project location.
  The build directory will update automatically.

NCSDK-9992: Multiple extra CMake options applied as single option
  If you specify two or more :guilabel:`Extra CMake Build Options` in the **Open nRF Connect SDK Project** dialog, those will be incorrectly treated as one option where the second option becomes a value to the first.
  For example: ``-DFOO=foo -DBAR=bar`` will define the CMake variable ``FOO`` having the value ``foo -DBAR=bar``.

  **Workaround:** Create a CMake preload script containing ``FOO`` and ``BAR`` settings, and then specify ``-C <pre-load-script>.cmake`` in :guilabel:`Extra CMake Build Options`.
