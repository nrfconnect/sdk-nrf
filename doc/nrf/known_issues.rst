NCSDK-6898: Setting :option:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT` does not work
  The immutable bootloader is not able to find the required metadata in the MCUboot image.
  See the related NCSDK-6898 known issue in `Build system`_ for more details.

  **Workaround:** Set :option:`CONFIG_FW_INFO` in MCUboot.

External antenna performance setting
  The preprogrammed Asset Tracker does not come with the best external antenna performance.

  **Workaround:** If you are using nRF9160 DK v0.15.0 or higher and Thingy:91 v1.4.0 or higher, set :option:`CONFIG_NRF9160_GPS_ANTENNA_EXTERNAL` to ``y``.
  Alternatively, for nRF9160 DK v0.15.0, you can set the :option:`CONFIG_NRF9160_GPS_COEX0_STRING` option to ``AT%XCOEX0`` when building the preprogrammed Asset Tracker to achieve the best external antenna performance.

NCSDK-7856: Faulty indirection on ``nrf_cc3xx`` memory slab when freeing the platform mutex
  The :cpp:func:`mutex_free_platform` function has a bug where a call to :cpp:func:`k_mem_slab_free` provides wrong indirection on a parameter to free the platform mutex.

  **Workaround:** Write the call to free the mutex in the following way: ``k_mem_slab_free(&mutex_slab, &mutex->mutex)``.
  The change adds ``&`` before the parameter ``mutex->mutex``.

NCSDK-7914: The ``nrf_cc3xx`` RSA implementation does not deduce missing parameters
  The calls to :cpp:func:`mbedtls_rsa_complete` will not deduce all types of missing RSA parameters when using ``nrf_cc3xx`` v0.9.6 or earlier.

  **Workaround:** Calculate the missing parameters outside of this function or update to ``nrf_cc3xx`` v0.9.7 or later.

NCSDK-8075: Invalid initialization of ``mbedtls_entropy_context`` mutex type
  The calls to :cpp:func:`mbedtls_entropy_init` do not zero-initialize the member variable ``mutex`` when ``nrf_cc3xx`` is enabled.

  **Workaround:** Zero-initialize the structure type before using it or make it a static variable to ensure that it is zero-initialized.

NCSDK-6073: ``nrf_send`` is blocking
  The :cpp:func:`nrf_send` function in the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem` might be blocking for several minutes, even if the socket is configured for non-blocking operation.
  The behavior depends on the cellular network connection.

  **Workaround:** For |NCS| v1.4.0, set the non-blocking mode for a partial workaround for non-blocking operation.

Problems with RTT Viewer/Logger
  The SEGGER Control Block cannot be found by automatic search by the RTT Viewer/Logger.

  **Workaround:** Set the RTT Control Block address to 0 and it will try to search from address 0 and upwards.
  If this does not work, look in the ``builddir/zephyr/zephyr.map`` file to find the address of the ``_SEGGER_RTT`` symbol in the map file and use that as input to the viewer/logger.

.. rst-class:: v1-5-1 v1-5-0 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0

No UART output is received from the network core if the application core is programmed and running with a non-secure image (using the ``nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuappns`` build target).

.. rst-class:: v1-5-1 v1-5-0

KRKNWK-6756: 802.15.4 Service Layer (SL) library support for the nRF53
  The binary variant of the 802.15.4 Service Layer (SL) library for the nRF53 does not support such features as synchronization of **TIMER** with **RTC** or timestamping of received frames.
  For this reason, 802.15.4 features like delayed transmission or delayed reception are not available for the nRF53.

.. rst-class:: v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

FOTA does not work
  FOTA with the :ref:`zephyr:smp_svr_sample` does not work.

nRF52820
========

.. rst-class:: v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

Missing :file:`CMakeLists.txt`
  The :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file for developing applications that emulate nRF52820 on the nRF52833 DK is missing.

  **Workaround:** Create a :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file in the :file:`ncs/zephyr/boards/arm/nrf52833dk_nrf52820` folder with the following content::

    zephyr_compile_definitions(DEVELOP_IN_NRF52833)
    zephyr_compile_definitions(NRFX_COREDEP_DELAY_US_LOOP_CYCLES=3)

  You can `download this file <nRF52820 CMakeLists.txt_>`_ from the upstream Zephyr repository.
  After you add it, the file is automatically included by the build system.

KRKNWK-6848: Reduced throughput
  Performance testing for the :ref:`ot_coprocessor_sample` sample shows a decrease of throughput of around 10-20% compared with the standard OpenThread.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0

KRKNWK-7885: Throughput is lower when using CC310 nrf_security backend
  A decrease of throughput of around 5-10% has been observed for the :ref:`CC310 nrf_security backend <nrfxlib:nrf_security_backends_cc3xx>` when compared with :ref:`nrf_oberon <nrf_security_backends_oberon>` or :ref:`the standard mbedtls backend <nrf_security_backends_orig_mbedtls>`.
  CC310 nrf_security backend is used by default for nRF52840 boards.
  The source of throughput decrease is coupled to the cost of RTOS mutex locking when using the :ref:`CC310 nrf_security backend <nrfxlib:nrf_security_backends_cc3xx>` when the APIs are called with shorter inputs.

  **Workaround:** Use AES-CCM ciphers from the nrf_oberon backend by setting the following options:

  * :option:`CONFIG_OBERON_BACKEND` to ``y``
  * :option:`CONFIG_OBERON_MBEDTLS_AES_C` to ``y``
  * :option:`CONFIG_OBERON_MBEDTLS_CCM_C` to ``y``
  * :option:`CONFIG_CC3XX_MBEDTLS_AES_C` to ``n``

KRKNWK-7721: MAC counter updating issue
  The ``RxDestAddrFiltered`` MAC counter is not being updated.
  This is because the ``PENDING_EVENT_RX_FAILED`` event is not implemented in Zephyr.

  **Workaround:** To fix the error, cherry-pick commits from the upstream `Zephyr PR #29226 <https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/29226>`_.

KRKNWK-7962: Logging interferes with shell output
  :option:`CONFIG_LOG_MINIMAL` is configured by default for most OpenThread samples.
  It accesses the UART independently from the shell backend, which sometimes leads to malformed output.

  **Workaround:** Disable logging or enable a more advanced logging option.

.. rst-class:: v1-5-1 v1-5-0 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0

KRKNWK-7803: Automatically generated libraries are missing otPlatLog for NCP
  When building OpenThread libraries using a different sample than the :ref:`ot_coprocessor_sample` sample, the :file:`ncp_base.cpp` is not compiled with the :c:func:`otPlatLog` function.
  This results in a linking failure when building the NCP with these libraries.

  **Workaround:** Use the :ref:`ot_coprocessor_sample` sample to create OpenThread libraries.

KRKNWK-8200: Sleepy End Device halts during the commissioning
  If the turbo poll is disabled in the ``ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_DEVICE_FIRST_START`` signal, SED halts during the commissioning.

  **Workaround**: Use the development libraries link or use ``ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_STEERING`` signal with successful status to disable turbo poll.
  See the following snippet for an example:

  .. code-block:: c

     /* Workaround for KRKNWK-8200 (turbo poll) */
     switch(sig)
     {
     case ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_DEVICE_REBOOT:
     case ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_STEERING:
             if (status == RET_OK) {
                     zb_zdo_pim_permit_turbo_poll(0);
                     zb_zdo_pim_set_long_poll_interval(2000);

     }

.. rst-class:: v1-5-1

KRKNWK-8200: Successful signal on commissioning fail
  A successful steering signal is generated if the commissioning fails during TCLK exchange.

  **Workaround**: Use the development libraries link or check for Extended PAN ID in the steering signal handler.
  If it is equal to zero, handle the signal as if it had unsuccessful status.
  See the following snippet for an example:

  .. code-block:: c

     /* Workaround for KRKNWK-8200 (signal status) */
     switch(sig)
     {
     case ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_STEERING:
             if (status == RET_OK) {
                     zb_ext_pan_id_t extended_pan_id;
                     zb_get_extended_pan_id(extended_pan_id);
                     if (!(ZB_IEEE_ADDR_IS_VALID(extended_pan_id))) {
                            zb_buf_set_status(bufid, -1);
                            status = -1;

DESK-978: Directed advertising issues with SoftDevice Link Layer
  Directed advertising (``CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_DIRECT_ADV``) should not be used by the :ref:`nrf_desktop` application when the :ref:`nrfxlib:softdevice_controller` is in use, because that leads to reconnection problems.
  For more detailed information, see the ``Known issues and limitations`` section of the SoftDevice Controller's :ref:`nrfxlib:softdevice_controller_changelog`.

  .. note::
     The Kconfig option name changed from ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_DIRECT_ADV`` to :option:`CONFIG_CAF_BLE_ADV_DIRECT_ADV` beginning with the nRF Connect SDK v1.5.99.

  **Workaround:** Directed advertising is disabled by default for nRF Desktop.

  The pairing failed and security changed callbacks are not called when the connection is disconnected during the pairing procedure or the required security is not met.

  **Workaround:** Application should use the disconnected callback to handle pairing failed.

NCSDK-8223: GATT requests might deadlock RX thread
  GATT requests might deadlock the RX thread when all TX buffers are taken by GATT requests and the RX thread tries to allocate a TX buffer for a response.
  This causes a deadlock because only the RX thread releases the TX buffers for the GATT requests.
  The deadlock is resolved by a 30 second timeout, but the ATT bearer cannot transmit without reconnecting.

  **Workaround:** Set :option:`CONFIG_BT_L2CAP_TX_BUF_COUNT` >= ``CONFIG_BT_ATT_TX_MAX`` + 2.

KRKNWK-7827: Application build system is not aware of the settings partition
  The application build system is not aware of partitions, including the settings partition, which can result in application code overlapping with other partitions.
  As a consequence, writing to overlapping partitions might remove or damage parts of the firmware, which can lead to errors that are difficult to debug.

  **Workaround:** Define and use a code partition to shrink the effective flash memory available for the application.
  You can use one of the following solutions:

  * :ref:`partition_manager` from |NCS| - see the page for all configuration options.
    For example, for single image (without bootloader and with the settings partition used), set the :option:`CONFIG_PM_SINGLE_IMAGE` Kconfig option to ``y`` and define the value for :option:`CONFIG_PM_PARTITION_SIZE_SETTINGS_STORAGE` to the required settings storage size.
  * :ref:`Devicetree code partition <zephyr:flash_map_api>` from Zephyr.
    Set :option:`CONFIG_USE_DT_CODE_PARTITION` Kconfig option to ``y``.
    Make sure that the code partition is defined and chosen correctly (``offset`` and ``size``).

NCSDK-7982: partition manager: Incorrect partition size linkage from name conflict
  Partition manager will incorrectly link a partition's size to the size of its container if the container partition's name matches its child image's name in ``CMakeLists.txt``.
  This can cause the inappropriately-sized partition to overwrite another partition beyond its intended boundary.

  **Workaround:** Rename the container partitions in the ``pm.yml`` and ``pm_static.yml`` files to something that does not match the child images' names, and rename the child images' main image partition to its name in ``CMakeLists.txt``.

DRGN-15465: Corrupted advertising data when :option:`CONFIG_BT_EXT_ADV` is set
  Setting scan response data for a legacy advertiser on a build with extended advertising support corrupts parts of the advertising data.
  When using ``BT_LE_ADV_OPT_USE_NAME`` (which is the default configuration in most samples), the device name is put in the scan response.
  This corrupts the advertising data.

  **Workaround:** Do not set scan response data.
  That implies not using the ``BT_LE_ADV_OPT_USE_NAME`` option, or the :c:macro:`BT_LE_ADV_CONN_NAME` macro when initializing Bluetooth.
  Instead, use :c:macro:`BT_LE_ADV_CONN`, and if necessary set the device name in the advertising data manually.

Several issues for nRF5340
  The following issues can occur when using SoftDevice Controller with nRF5340:

  * Poor performance when performing active scanning.
  * The controller could assert when receiving extended advertising packets.
  * The ``T_IFS`` could in certain conditions be off by 5 us.
  * The radio could stay in the TX state longer than expected.
    This issue can only occur when sending a packet on either LE 1M or LE 2M PHY after receiving or transmitting a packet on LE Coded PHY.
    If this occurs while performing a Link Layer Control Procedure, the controller could end up retransmitting an acknowledged packet, resulting in a disconnect.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0 v1-0-0

Sending control packet twice
  A control packet could be sent twice even after the packet was acknowledged.
  This would only occur if the radio was forced off due to an unforeseen condition.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0 v1-0-0

Wait time required after a directed high duty cycle advertiser times out
  The application is unable to restart a connectable advertiser right after a high-duty-cycle advertiser times out.

  **Workaround:** Wait 500 ms before restarting a connectable advertiser

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0 v1-0-0

Assert risk after performing a DLE procedure
  The controller could assert when receiving a packet with a CRC error on LE Coded PHY after performing a DLE procedure where RX Octets is changed to a value above 140.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0 v1-0-0

Assert when using HCI LE Set Extended Advertising Parameters
  The controller will assert when setting secondary PHY to 0 when using HCI LE Set Extended Advertising Parameters and the advertising type is set to legacy advertising.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0 v1-0-0

HCI issues with duplicate filtering
  HCI LE Set Extended Scan Enable returns `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE` when duplicate filtering is enabled.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0 v1-0-0

HCI issues with `secondary_max_skip`
  HCI LE Set Advertising Parameters returns `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE` when `secondary_max_skip` is set to a non-zero value.

.. rst-class:: v1-0-0

No data issue when connected to multiple devices
  :c:func:`hci_data_get()` may return "No data available" when there is data available.
  This issue will only occur when connected to multiple devices at the same time.

.. rst-class:: v1-0-0

Assert on LE Write Suggested Default Data Length
  The controller will assert if the host issues LE Write Suggested Default Data Length.

.. rst-class:: v1-0-0

HCI LE Set Privacy Mode appears as not supported
  The controller does not indicate support for HCI LE Set Privacy Mode although it is supported.

.. rst-class:: v1-0-0

Assert if advertising data is set after HCI Reset
  The controller will assert if advertising data is set after HCI Reset without first setting advertising parameters.

.. rst-class:: v1-0-0

Assert on writing to flash
  The controller may assert when writing to flash.

.. rst-class:: v1-0-0

Timeout without sending packet
  A directed advertiser may time out without sending a packet on air.

.. rst-class:: v1-2-1 v1-2-0

Incorrect pin definition for nRF5340
  For nRF5340, the pins **P1.12** to **P1.15** are unavailable due to an incorrect pin number definition in the MDK.

nrfx_saadc driver
=================

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0 v1-0-0 v0-4-0

Samples might be swapped
  Samples might be swapped when buffer is set after starting the sample process, when more than one channel is sampled.
  This can happen when the sample task is connected using PPI and setting buffers and sampling are not synchronized.

nrfx_uarte driver
=================

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0 v1-0-0 v0-4-0

RX and TX not disabled in uninit
  The driver does not disable RX and TX in uninit, which can cause higher power consumption.

nrfx_uart driver
================

.. rst-class:: v1-0-0 v0-4-0

tx_buffer_length set incorrectly
  The nrfx_uart driver might incorrectly set the internal tx_buffer_length variable when high optimization level is set during compilation.

NCSIDB-108: Thread context switch might lead to a kernel fault
  If the Zephyr kernel preempts the current thread and performs a context switch to a new thread while the current thread is executing a secure service, the behavior is undefined and might lead to a kernel fault.
  To prevent this situation, a thread that aims to call a secure service must temporarily lock the kernel scheduler (:cpp:func:`k_sched_lock`) and unlock the scheduler (:cpp:func:`k_sched_unlock`) after returning from the secure call.

NCSDK-6852: Extra CMake options might not be applied in version 5.10d
  If you specify :guilabel:`Extra CMake Build Options` in the :guilabel:`Open nRF Connect SDK Project` dialog and at the same time select an :guilabel:`nRF Connect Toolchain Version` of the form ``X.Y.Z``, the additional CMake options are discarded.

  **Workaround:** Select ``NONE (Use SES settings / environment PATH)`` from the  :guilabel:`nRF Connect Toolchain Version` drop-down if you want to specify :guilabel:`Extra CMake Build Options`.

NCSDK-8372: Project name collision causes SES Nordic Edition to load the wrong project
  Some samples that are located in different folders use the same project name.
  For example, there is a ``light_switch`` project both in the :file:`samples/bluetooth/mesh/` folder and in the :file:`samples/zigbee/` folder.
  When you select one of these samples from the project list in the :guilabel:`Open nRF Connect SDK Project` dialog, the wrong sample might be selected.
  Check the :guilabel:`Build Directory` field in the dialog to see if this is the case.
  The field indicates the path to the project that SES Nordic Edition will load.

  **Workaround:** If the path in :guilabel:`Build Directory` points to the wrong project, select the correct project by using the :guilabel:`...` button for :guilabel:`Projects` and navigating to the correct project location.
  The build directory will update automatically.
