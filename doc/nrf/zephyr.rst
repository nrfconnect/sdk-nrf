Zephyr documentation
####################

The documentation of the Zephyr Project RTOS is available :doc:`here <zephyr:index>`. It contains some Nordic Semiconductor specific additions to the official Zephyr Project documentation.

Note that you can switch between the Zephyr documentation and the |NCS| documentation by using the selector in the bottom-left corner of each page.

The Zephyr project documentation without Nordic Semiconductor's additions is available at |link_zephyr_doc|_.
