ABI compatibility
#################

.. contents::

   :depth: 2

Application Binary Interface (ABI) compatibility defines how software components, such as libraries and applications, interact at the machine code level through their low-level binary interface.
This includes:

* Function-calling conventions
* Data structure layouts in memory
* Exception handling mechanisms
* Register usage conventions

When ABI compatibility is maintained, binaries of one component can interface correctly with another without requiring recompilation.
For example, adding a new function to a library is typically an ABI-compatible change, as existing binaries remain functional.
However, changes that affect data structure layouts, such as altering field order or size, break ABI compatibility because they change the memory layout expected by existing binaries.

nRF54H20 SoC binaries changelog
*******************************

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

IronSide Secure Element (IronSide SE) v23.0.1+16
================================================

Changed
-------

* The domain-specific built-in keys identified by ``CRACEN_BUILTIN_*_ID``. (NCSDK-35202)
* The way IronSide SE treats the ``UICR.VERSION`` field. (NCSDK-35253)

  The erase value is now interpreted as the highest supported UICR format version.
  Other values must match a supported version or cause a boot error.
  Currently, only version 2.0 (``0x00020000``) is supported.
* IronSide SE no longer disables RETAIN for every GPIO pin at boot. (NCSDK-35080)

  Pins are now retained when the application boots, and the application must disable retention before using them.
* ``UICR.LOCK`` can now be set in ``LCS_EMPTY`` without hindering LFCLK calibration. (NCSDK-34458)

Fixed
-----

* EXMIF XIP region is now accessible. (NCSDK-35256)

* Support for a secondary boot mode. (NCSDK-32171)

  The secondary mode lets you define a separate application firmware that is started on boot error or when requested over IPC.
  This is configured through the ``UICR.SECONDARY`` registers and can be used for recovery or updates.
* Support for ``UICR.WDTSTART``, which can be used to automatically start a local domain watchdog ahead of the application boot. (NCSDK-35046)
* Support for PSA Internal Trusted Storage (ITS). (NCSDK-18548)

  It is configured through the following ``UICR.SECURESTORAGE`` registers:

  * ``UICR.SECURESTORAGE.CRYPTO`` - Enables persistent key storage for the PSA Crypto API.
  * ``UICR.SECURESTORAGE.ITS`` - Enables the PSA ITS API for managing other sensitive assets.
  * ``UICR.SECURESTORAGE.ENABLE`` and ``UICR.SECURESTORAGE.ADDRESS`` - Required to enable one or both features.

* Support for the IronSide SE DVFS service, replacing the NRFS DVFS service. (NRFX-7321)

Updated
-------

* Renamed the release artifact from :file:`sysctrl.hex` to :file:`ironside_se.hex` to correctly reflect its content.

Removed
-------

* NRFS DVFS service support.

================================================

Fixed
-----

* An issue where the device became stuck in recovery mode after performing a recovery upgrade. (NCSDK-34258)
* An issue where the eraseall operation, on a device in LCS ROT, was permitted regardless of the contents of UICR. (NCSDK-34232)
* An issue where the recovery firmware would incorrectly determine that UICR was corrupted. (NCSDK-32241)

Updated
-------

* sysctrl to 5.0.1: stability improvements.

IronSide Secure Element (IronSide SE) v22.0.3+11
================================================

Fixed
-----

* psa_crypto:

   * Bytes written are now correctly returned (in place of buffer size). (NCSDK-34172)
   * Added missing ECC_MONTGOMERY_255 configuration. (NCSDK-34200)
   * Passing 0-sized buffers are now allowed for optional arguments. (NCSDK-34171).

IronSide Secure Element (IronSide SE) v22.0.1+9
===============================================

No functional change.
Version bump to verify update with live versions.

IronSide Secure Element (IronSide SE) v22.0.0+8
===============================================

Added
-----

* This release is now signed with Nordic keys.
  The SWD connection is still required to update IronSide using official tools.
  For more information, run ``west ncs-ironside-se-update --help``.
  A backward LCS transition is not required to update IronSide.
* Added support for ``UICR.PROTECTEDMEM``, which enables integrity checking of an immutable bootloader.

Updated
-------

* Increased the size of USLOT (IronSide + sysctrl) to 120 kB.
* Increased the size of RSLOT (IronSide recovery firmware) to 20 kB.
* Enabled downgrade protection for IronSide in debug builds.
* Changed the owner ID used in the default global domain SPU configurations from ``NONE`` to ``APPLICATION``.
  This means that all peripherals and split-ownership registers are accessible by the application core, PPR and FLPR by default.
  Use ``UICR.PERIPHCONF`` to grant the radio core access to global domain peripherals.

IronSide Secure Element (IronSide SE) v21.1.1
=============================================

* Updated to not require CHIDX values to be set when configuring ``PPIB_SUBSCRIBE_SEND`` or ``PPIB_PUBLISH_RECEIVE`` through ``PERIPHCONF``.
* Fixed an issue where the application core was booted despite the presence of boot errors.

IronSide Secure Element (IronSide SE) v21.1.0
=============================================

Added
-----

* MAC in the PSA Crypto service.
* Static memory checks that protect Nordic assets by whitelisting only memory ranges available to the application developers.
* System Controller Firmware (SCFW) releases in the IronSide SE releases.
  See :ref:`scfw_5_0_0` for details.

Updated
-------

* The CPUCONF service request definition.
* The CPU and WAIT parameters are now both packed into the first 4-byte value, and the message data is sent inline in the request.
* Support for initializing a subset of global domain peripherals by configuring ``UICR.PERIPHCONF``.
  This enables the initial configuration of the CTRLSEL GPIO pin, global IRQ mapping, IPC mapping, global PPIBs, and more.
* ``UICR.PERIPHCONF`` reintroduces functionality that was previously available with specialized ``UICR.*`` registers, but with a lower-level interface that is more powerful, flexible, and future proof.

.. _scfw_5_0_0:

IronSide Secure Element (IronSide SE) v21.0.0
=============================================

Added
-----

* Support for the IronSide SE update service. (NCSDK-32173)
  This service allows updating IronSide SE firmware using the ``west ncs-ironside-se-update`` command.
  The update is performed over SWD, and the device must be in a debug mode.

IronSide Secure Element (IronSide SE) v20.1.0
=============================================

Added
-----

  This is built on top of a temporary IPC mechanism which will soon be replaced.
  The top-level interface will remain the same. (NCSDK-32163)

  The PSA Crypto API support through the :ref:`ug_crypto_architecture_implementation_standards_ironside` is currently limited to the following ``PSA_WANT`` symbols for :ref:`cryptographic feature selection <crypto_drivers_feature_selection>`:

  * ``PSA_WANT_GENERATE_RANDOM``
  * ``PSA_WANT_ALG_SHA_256``
  * ``PSA_WANT_ALG_SHA_512``

  * ``PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_ECC_PUBLIC_KEY``
  * ``PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_ECC_KEY_PAIR_IMPORT``
  * ``PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_ECC_KEY_PAIR_EXPORT``
  * ``PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_ECC_KEY_PAIR_GENERATE``
  * ``PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_ECC_KEY_PAIR_DERIVE``

  To use the service, set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_SECURITY` to ``y``.
  For more information on the implementations available in the cryptographic drivers, see the :ref:`crypto_drivers`.

  .. note::
     The v20.1.0 support for this PSA Certified Crypto API is not compatible with |NCS| v3.0.0 or v3.1.0.
     It is only compatible with the ``sdk-nrf`` revision ``1b2abb07b8b2528ecaf86f54e0c6cf48c425055a``.
