* Fixed an issue where Bluetooth applications built with the ``nordic-bt-rpc`` snippet (in the :ref:`ble_rpc` configuration) did not work on the nRF54H20 devices due to incorrect memory mapping.

* Updated the Bluetooth LE SoftDevice Controller driver to make the :c:func:`hci_vs_sdc_llpm_mode_set` function return an error if Low Latency Packet Mode (LLPM) is not supported or not enabled in the Bluetooth LE Controller driver configuration (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_SDC_LLPM`).

Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

Machine learning
----------------

* Updated the application to enable the :ref:`Zephyr Memory Storage (ZMS) <zephyr:zms_api>` file system for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board.

Asset Tracker v2
----------------

* Updated the application to use the :ref:`lib_downloader` library instead of the deprecated :ref:`lib_download_client` library.

Connectivity Bridge
-------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

IPC radio firmware
------------------

* Updated the application to enable the :ref:`Zephyr Memory Storage (ZMS) <zephyr:zms_api>` file system in all devices that contain MRAM, such as the nRF54H Series devices.

Matter Bridge
-------------

* Enabled SUIT DFU support for the :ref:`matter_bridge_app` application.
  Currently, only the Matter OTA protocol is fully supported for SUIT DFU purposes.
* Enabled Link Time Optimization (LTO) by default for the ``release`` configuration.

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Updated:

  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_failsafe` to use the Zephyr :ref:`zephyr:hwinfo_api` driver for getting and clearing the reset reason information (see the :c:func:`hwinfo_get_reset_cause` and :c:func:`hwinfo_clear_reset_cause` functions).
    The Zephyr :ref:`zephyr:hwinfo_api` driver replaces the dependency on the nrfx reset reason helper (see the :c:func:`nrfx_reset_reason_get` and :c:func:`nrfx_reset_reason_clear` functions).
  * The release configuration for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board target to enable the :ref:`nrf_desktop_failsafe` (see the :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_FAILSAFE_ENABLE <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option).
  * Enabled Link Time Optimization (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTO` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ISR_TABLES_LOCAL_DECLARATION`) by default for an nRF Desktop application image.
    LTO was also explicitly enabled in configurations of other images built by sysbuild (bootloader, network core image).
  * Application configurations for nRF54L05, nRF54L10, and nRF54L15 SoCs to use Fast Pair PSA cryptography (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_CRYPTO_PSA`).
    Using PSA cryptography improves security and reduces memory footprint.
    Also increased the size of the Bluetooth receiving thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_RX_STACK_SIZE`) to prevent stack overflows.
  * Application configurations for nRF52810 and nRF52820 SoCs to reduce memory footprint:

    * Disabled Bluetooth long workqueue (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_LONG_WQ`).
    * Limited the number of key slots in the PSA Crypto core to 10 (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_KEY_SLOT_COUNT`).

  * Application configurations for HID peripherals by increasing the following thread stack sizes to prevent stack overflows during the :c:func:`settings_load` operation:

    * The system workqueue thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SYSTEM_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE`).
    * The CAF settings loader thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_SETTINGS_LOADER_THREAD_STACK_SIZE`).

    This change results from the Bluetooth subsystem transition to the PSA cryptographic API.
    The GATT database hash calculation now requires larger stack size.

* Added:

  * System Power Management for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board target on the application and radio cores.
  * Application configurations for the nRF54L05 and nRF54L10 SoCs (emulated on the nRF54L15 DK).
    The configurations are supported through ``nrf54l15dk/nrf54l10/cpuapp`` and ``nrf54l15dk/nrf54l05/cpuapp`` board targets.
    For details, see the :ref:`nrf_desktop_board_configuration`.
  * The ``dongle_small`` configuration for the nRF52833 DK.
    The configuration enables logs and mimics the dongle configuration used for small SoCs.

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Serial LTE modem
----------------

* Added an overlay :file:`overlay-memfault.conf` file to enable Memfault.
  For more information about Memfault features in |NCS|, see :ref:`mod_memfault`.
* Updated the application to use the :ref:`lib_downloader` library instead of the deprecated :ref:`lib_download_client` library.

Thingy:53: Matter weather station
---------------------------------

* Enabled Link Time Optimization (LTO) by default for the ``release`` configuration.

Samples
=======

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`sample <samples>`.

Amazon Sidewalk samples

  * :ref:`bluetooth_central_hids`
  * :ref:`peripheral_hids_keyboard`

* Updated:

    * The configurations of the non-secure ``nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns`` board target in the following samples to properly use the TF-M profile instead of the predefined minimal TF-M profile:

      * :ref:`bluetooth_central_hids`
      * :ref:`peripheral_hids_keyboard`
      * :ref:`peripheral_hids_mouse`

      This change results from the Bluetooth subsystem transition to the PSA cryptographic standard.
      The Bluetooth stack can now use the PSA crypto API in the non-secure domain as all necessary TF-M partitions are configured properly.

      * :ref:`bluetooth_central_hids`
      * :ref:`peripheral_hids_keyboard`
      * :ref:`peripheral_hids_mouse`

      This change results from the Bluetooth subsystem transition to the PSA cryptographic API.

    This change results from the Bluetooth subsystem transition to the PSA cryptographic standard.
    The Bluetooth stack can now use the PSA crypto API in the non-secure domain as all necessary TF-M partitions are configured properly.
  * The configuration of all Fast Pair samples by increasing the following thread stack sizes to prevent stack overflows:

    * The system workqueue thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SYSTEM_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE`).
    * The Bluetooth receiving thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_RX_STACK_SIZE`).

    This change results from the Bluetooth subsystem transition to the PSA cryptographic API.

* :ref:`fast_pair_locator_tag` sample:

  * Added support for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board target.
  * Updated the partition layout for the ``nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns`` and ``thingy53/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns`` board targets to accommodate the partitions needed due to change in the TF-M profile configuration.

* :ref:`nrf_cloud_multi_service` sample:

  * Fixed:

    * Wrong header naming in :file:`provisioning_support.h` that was causing build errors when :file:`sample_reboot.h` was included in other source files.
    * An issue with an uninitialized variable in the :c:func:`handle_at_cmd_requests` function.

      in the :file:`overlay-coap_nrf_provisioning.conf` file.
    * Slow Wi-Fi connectivity startup by selecting ``TFM_SFN`` instead of ``TFM_IPC``.

MCUboot
=======

The MCUboot fork in |NCS| (``sdk-mcuboot``) contains all commits from the upstream MCUboot repository up to and including ``a2bc982b3379d51fefda3e17a6a067342dce1a8b``, with some |NCS| specific additions.

The code for integrating MCUboot into |NCS| is located in the :file:`ncs/nrf/modules/mcuboot` folder.

The following list summarizes both the main changes inherited from upstream MCUboot and the main changes applied to the |NCS| specific additions:

* Fixed an issue where an unusable secondary slot was cleared three times instead of once during cleanup.

Zephyr
======

.. NOTE TO MAINTAINERS: All the Zephyr commits in the below git commands must be handled specially after each upmerge and each nRF Connect SDK release.

The Zephyr fork in |NCS| (``sdk-zephyr``) contains all commits from the upstream Zephyr repository up to and including ``fdeb7350171279d4637c536fcceaad3fbb775392``, with some |NCS| specific additions.

For the list of upstream Zephyr commits (not including cherry-picked commits) incorporated into nRF Connect SDK since the most recent release, run the following command from the :file:`ncs/zephyr` repository (after running ``west update``):

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline fdeb735017 ^beb733919d

For the list of |NCS| specific commits, including commits cherry-picked from upstream, run:

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline manifest-rev ^fdeb735017

The current |NCS| main branch is based on revision ``fdeb735017`` of Zephyr.

.. note::
   For possible breaking changes and changes between the latest Zephyr release and the current Zephyr version, refer to the :ref:`Zephyr release notes <zephyr_release_notes>`.
