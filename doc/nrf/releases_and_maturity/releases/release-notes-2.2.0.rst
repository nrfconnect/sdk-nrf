nRF9160: Asset Tracker v2
-------------------------

* Added:

  * Handling for the new data receive events in the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library.
    This is a major change in the application code but a minor change from the user perspective.
  * :ref:`asset_tracker_v2_location_module`.
    GNSS is used through the :ref:`lib_location` library.

* Updated:

  * The application now uses the new LwM2M location assistance objects through the :ref:`lib_lwm2m_location_assistance` library.
  * The application now uses passive mode as the default mode for Thingy:91 builds.
  * The application now uses the :ref:`lib_location` library for retrieving location information.
    This is a major change in the application code but a minor change from the user perspective.
  * Neighbor cell handling moved from :ref:`asset_tracker_v2_modem_module` to :ref:`asset_tracker_v2_location_module` to be used through Location library.
  * The :ref:`asset_tracker_v2_location_module` triggers a :c:func:`location_request` with GNSS being the first priority method and cellular the second priority if they are enabled in the application configuration.
  * A-GPS/P-GPS are not requested based on triggers in the application but only based on :ref:`lib_location` library events :c:enum:`LOCATION_EVT_GNSS_ASSISTANCE_REQUEST` and :c:enum:`LOCATION_EVT_GNSS_PREDICTION_REQUEST`.
  * Currently, you cannot configure or define the LTE LC neighbor cell search type with the :ref:`lib_location` library.
    The default search type is always used.
  * The Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_GNSS_MODULE_PGPS_STORE_LOCATION` (calling :c:func:`nrf_cloud_pgps_set_location`) is not supported in the :ref:`lib_location` library.

* Removed:

  * GNSS module.
  * A-GPS and P-GPS processing.
    It is now handled by the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library.

    The figure now correctly shows the interaction with the Bluetooth modules.
  * An issue with Simple Management Protocol (SMP) not advertising in the CIS mode.
  * An issue with the ``mcumgr`` command being unable to receive in the BIS mode.
  * The :ref:`nrf53_audio_app_porting_guide` section in the documentation did not mention long-pressing **BTN 4** while resetting the development kit to start DFU.
    This has now been added to the documentation.

* Removed support for the nRF5340 Audio DK (PCA10121) board version 0.7.1 or older.

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

* Removed the support for Thingy:52 (``thingy52_nrf52832``).

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Added:

  * :ref:`nrf_desktop_fast_pair_app`.
    The module is used in configurations that integrate Google `Fast Pair`_.
  * :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_LED_STATE_DEF_PATH <config_desktop_app_options>`.
    The option can be used to specify the file defining the used LED effects.
  * The application configurations that enable `Fast Pair`_.
    See nRF Desktop's :ref:`nrf_desktop_bluetooth_guide_fast_pair` documentation section for details.

  * :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_USB_REMOTE_WAKEUP <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option for :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state`.
    The option enables the USB wakeup functionality in the application.
    The option selects :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_REMOTE_WAKEUP`.

  * Application-specific Kconfig options to simplify the configuration.
    Part of an application Kconfig configuration that is common for the selected HID device type is introduced as overlays for default Kconfig values.
    See :ref:`nrf_desktop_porting_guide` for details.

* Updated:

  * The ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_SCANNING_ENABLE`` Kconfig option has been renamed to :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_SCAN_ENABLE <config_desktop_app_options>`.
  * The UUID16 values of GATT Human Interface Device Service (HIDS) and GATT Battery Service (BAS) have been moved from advertising data to scan response data.
  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_GATT_SERVICE_CHANGED` Kconfig option is disabled on nRF Desktop dongles to reduce memory footprint.
  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ID_UNPAIR_MATCHING_BONDS` is now enabled by default.
    This is done to pass the Fast Pair Validator's end-to-end integration tests and to improve the user experience during the erase advertising procedure.
  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ID_ALLOW_UNAUTH_OVERWRITE` Kconfig option is enabled by default for the HID peripherals.
    This setting improves the user experience as it is no longer required to delete the bonding information from the old identity to pair using the new one.

    * Location data details such as entire PVT data.
    * MQTT support for nRF Cloud Wi-Fi positioning.
    * Improved LTE-GNSS interworking and added possibility to trigger GNSS priority mode if GNSS does not get long-enough time windows due to LTE idle mode operations.

  * Updated:

    * Location method has been moved from the :c:struct:`location_data` structure to :c:struct:`location_event_data`.
    * The library now uses :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_location` library for nRF Cloud Wi-Fi positioning.

* :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library:

  * Added support for GCI (Global Cell ID) neighbor cell measurement search types, which are supported by the modem firmware versions from and including v1.3.4.

  * Updated the parameter type in the :c:func:`lte_lc_neighbor_cell_measurement` function to :c:struct:`lte_lc_ncellmeas_params`.

* Renamed the AT SMS Cert library to :ref:`lib_gcf_sms_readme`.
  The :ref:`lib_gcf_sms_readme` library now uses the :ref:`at_cmd_custom_readme` library to register filtered AT commands.

Libraries for networking
------------------------

* Added :ref:`lib_lwm2m_location_assistance` library that supports using A-GPS, P-GPS, and ground fix assistance from nRF Cloud through an LwM2M server.

* Multicell location library:

  * Removed the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MULTICELL_LOCATION_MAX_NEIGHBORS`.
    The maximum number of supported neighbor cell measurements for HERE location services depends on the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_NEIGHBOR_CELLS_MAX` Kconfig option.

* :ref:`lib_download_client` library:

  * Updated the library so that it does not retry download on disconnect.
  * Fixed a race condition when starting the download.

    * The library now processes A-GPS and P-GPS data; it is no longer passed to the application.
    * The status field of :c:enum:`NRF_CLOUD_EVT_ERROR` events uses values from the enumeration :c:enumerator:`nrf_cloud_error_status`.
    * UI service info and sensor type strings now refer to ``GNSS`` instead of ``GPS``.
    * Renamed the enumeration value ``NRF_CLOUD_EVT_RX_DATA_CELL_POS`` to :c:enum:`NRF_CLOUD_EVT_RX_DATA_LOCATION`.

  * Removed:

    * An unused parameter of the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_connect` function.
    * An unused :c:func:`nrf_cloud_shadow_update` function.

* :ref:`lib_lwm2m_client_utils` library:

  * Added support for using X509 certificates.

* :ref:`lib_fota_download` library:

      This happened when custom download transport was not used.

* Renamed the nRF Cloud cellular positioning library to :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_location`.
  In addition to cellular location, the library now supports device location from nRF Cloud using Wi-Fi network information.

Libraries for NFC
-----------------

* :ref:`lib_nfc_ndef`:

  * Fixed a write to a constant field in the :c:func:`ac_rec_payload_parse` function.

* :ref:`nfc_t4t_isodep_readme`:

  * Fixed out of bounds access in the :c:func:`ats_parse` function.

Other libraries
---------------

* Added:

  * :ref:`lib_sfloat` library.
  * :ref:`lib_hw_id` library to retrieve a unique hardware ID.

* :ref:`emds_readme` library:

  * Updated:

    * The library implementation bypasses the flash driver when storing the emergency data.
      This allows calling the :c:func:`emds_store` function from an interrupt context.
    * The internal thread for storing the emergency data has been removed.
      The emergency data is now stored by the :c:func:`emds_store` function.

* :ref:`mod_dm` module:

  * Added a window length configuration to be used runtime, when a new measurement request is added.

  * Updated:

    * The calculation of MPSL timeslot length has been improved by using the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_dm` functionality.
    * Renamed the ``access_address`` field to ``rng_seed`` in the :c:struct:`dm_request` structure.

* :ref:`app_event_manager`:

  * Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_APP_EVENT_MANAGER_SHELL` Kconfig option.
    The option can be used to disable Event Manager shell commands.

* :ref:`nrf_profiler`:

  * Added the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_PROFILER_SHELL` Kconfig option.
    The option can be used to disable the nRF Profiler shell commands.

Common Application Framework (CAF)
----------------------------------

* :ref:`caf_ble_state`:

  * Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_BLE_STATE_MAX_LOCAL_ID_BONDS`.
    The option allows to specify the maximum number of allowed bonds in each Bluetooth local identity for a Bluetooth Peripheral.

* :ref:`caf_sensor_manager`:

  * Added:

    * Dynamic control for the :ref:`sensor sample period <sensor_sample_period>`.
    * Test for the sample.

DFU libraries
-------------
* :ref:`lib_dfu_target` library:

  * Added new types :c:enum:`DFU_TARGET_IMAGE_TYPE_ANY_MODEM` and :c:enum:`DFU_TARGET_IMAGE_TYPE_ANY_APPLICATION`.
    This makes any supported modem update type acceptable when downloading.

  * Updated the library such that calling the :c:func:`dfu_target_reset()` function clears all images that have already been downloaded into a target area.
    This allows cancelling any update packages even if they are already marked to be updated.

MPSL libraries
--------------

* Added :ref:`mpsl_lib`.

sdk-nrfxlib
-----------

See the changelog for each library in the :doc:`nrfxlib documentation <nrfxlib:README>` for additional information.

Scripts
=======

* :ref:`west_sbom`:

  * Updated the SPDX License List database to version 3.18.

* :ref:`partition_manager`:

  * Added:

    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_PARTITION_ALIGN_SETTINGS_STORAGE` Kconfig option to specify the alignment of the settings storage partition.
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_EXTERNAL_FLASH_HAS_DRIVER` Kconfig option.
      This option must be selected by drivers providing support for external flash.
      It is automatically selected by :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NORDIC_QSPI_NOR` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SPI_NOR`.
      MCUboot might fail to boot when the external flash memory is used for non-primary application images and when the driver for the external flash memory is not enabled.
      See :ref:`ug_bootloader_external_flash` and :ref:`pm_external_flash` for details.
    * P-GPS partition section to the :file:`ncs/nrf/subsys/partition_manager/Kconfig` file.
    * Board-specific static Partition Manager configuration shared among build types.
      The configuration can be defined in the board's directory.

  * Updated the :file:`ncs/nrf/subsys/partition_manager/pm.yml.pgps` file to place P-GPS partition in external flash when so configured.

  * Fixed an issue with the driver and devicetree symbol for the external flash memory where the driver was sometimes NULL, even if the DT node was chosen.

    .. note::
       If your project includes MCUboot and uses external flash for storing secondary images, after applying this fix, you need to configure ``nordic,pm-ext-flash`` property in a devicetree overlay for the MCUboot child image.
       Otherwise, MCUboot will not be able to read a flash area in the external flash to pick up a new firmware image.

* Unity:

  * Added:

    * Support for excluding functions from mock generation.
      This provides a framework to implement custom mocks.

  * Updated:

    * The generated mock functions have been renamed from ``__wrap`` to ``__cmock``.
    * The generated mock headers have been renamed from :file:`mock_<header_file>.h` to :file:`cmock_<header_file>.h`.
    * The compiler option ``--defsym`` is used instead of ``--wrap``.

MCUboot
=======

The MCUboot fork in |NCS| (``sdk-mcuboot``) contains all commits from the upstream MCUboot repository up to and including ``cfec947e0f8be686d02c73104a3b1ad0b5dcf1e6``, with some |NCS| specific additions.

The code for integrating MCUboot into |NCS| is located in the :file:`ncs/nrf/modules/mcuboot` folder.

The following list summarizes both the main changes inherited from upstream MCUboot and the main changes applied to the |NCS| specific additions:

* Added:

  * Precise check of the image size.
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USE_NRF53_MULTI_IMAGE_WITHOUT_UPGRADE_ONLY` Kconfig option to specify that you want to use nRF53 multi-image upgrade without the upgrade only setting in MCUboot.
    Enabling this option has drawbacks.
    See the :ref:`ug_nrf5340` user guide for details.
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOT_SERIAL_MAX_RECEIVE_SIZE` Kconfig option to specify the size of the serial recovery command buffer, which was previously fixed at 512 bytes.
    The new default value is 1024 bytes to allow for larger commands (and increased transfer speed).

* Updated loader by adding post copy hook to swap function.

* Fixed:

  * RAM loading for Arm with correct handling of vector table when code has moved to RAM.
  * An issue with QSPI stack alignment in serial recovery, which prevented writing data to QSPI slots.
  * An issue in serial recovery where rc is wrongly returned as an unsigned integer.
