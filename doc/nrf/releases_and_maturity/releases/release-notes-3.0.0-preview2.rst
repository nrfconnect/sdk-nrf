Changelog
*********

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

IDE, OS, and tool support
=========================

* Updated:

  * The required `SEGGER J-Link`_ version to v8.18.
  * The :ref:`installation` page with the following:

    * The :ref:`installing_vsc` section with a list valid for both development environments.
      The list now includes nRF Util as an additional requirement for :ref:`west runner <programming_selecting_runner>` for the |nRFVSC|, and the Windows-only requirement to install SEGGER USB Driver for J-Link for both development environments.
    * The command-line instructions now use the ``nrfutil sdk-manager`` command instead of the ``nrfutil toolchain-manager`` command.
      You can read more about the new command in the `nRF Util documentation <sdk-manager command_>`_.


Board support
=============

* Removed support for the nRF52810 Desktop Mouse board (``nrf52810dmouse/nrf52810``).

Build and configuration system
==============================

* Removed support for the deprecated multi-image builds (parent-child images) functionality.
  All |NCS| projects must now use :ref:`sysbuild`.
  See :ref:`child_parent_to_sysbuild_migration` for an overview of differences with parent-child image and how to migrate.
* Updated the default runner for the ``west flash`` command to `nRF Util`_ instead of ``nrfjprog`` that is part of the archived `nRF Command Line Tools`_.
  For more information, see the :ref:`build system section in the v3.0.0 migration guide <migration_3.0_recommended>` and the :ref:`programming_selecting_runner` section on the programming page.

Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

Machine learning
----------------

* Updated the application to enable the :ref:`Zephyr Memory Storage (ZMS) <zephyr:zms_api>` file system for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board.

Asset Tracker v2
----------------

* Updated the application to use the :ref:`lib_downloader` library instead of the deprecated :ref:`lib_download_client` library.

Connectivity Bridge
-------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

IPC radio firmware
------------------

* Updated:

  * The application to enable the :ref:`Zephyr Memory Storage (ZMS) <zephyr:zms_api>` file system in all devices that contain MRAM, such as the nRF54H Series devices.
  * The documentation of applications and samples that use the IPC radio firmware as a :ref:`companion component <companion_components>` to mention its usage when built with :ref:`configuration_system_overview_sysbuild`.

Matter Bridge
-------------

* Updated by enabling Link Time Optimization (LTO) by default for the ``release`` configuration.
* Removed support for the nRF54H20 devices.

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Added:

  * System Power Management for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board target on the application and radio cores.
  * Application configurations for the nRF54L05 and nRF54L10 SoCs (emulated on the nRF54L15 DK).
    The configurations are supported through ``nrf54l15dk/nrf54l10/cpuapp`` and ``nrf54l15dk/nrf54l05/cpuapp`` board targets.
    For details, see the :ref:`nrf_desktop_board_configuration`.
  * The ``dongle_small`` configuration for the nRF52833 DK.
    The configuration enables logs and mimics the dongle configuration used for small SoCs.
  * Requirement for zero latency in Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:pm-system` while USB is active (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_USB_PM_REQ_NO_PM_LATENCY <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option of the :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state_pm`).
    The feature is enabled by default if Zephyr power management (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM`) is enabled.
    It prevents entering power states that introduce wakeup latency and ensure high performance.
  * Static Partition Manager memory maps for single-image configurations (without bootloader and separate radio/network core image).
    In the |NCS|, the Partition Manager is enabled by default for single-image sysbuild builds.
    The static memory map ensures control over settings partition placement and size.
    The introduced static memory maps may not be consistent with the ``storage_partition`` defined by the board-level DTS configuration.

* Updated:

  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_failsafe` to use the Zephyr :ref:`zephyr:hwinfo_api` driver for getting and clearing the reset reason information (see the :c:func:`hwinfo_get_reset_cause` and :c:func:`hwinfo_clear_reset_cause` functions).
    The Zephyr :ref:`zephyr:hwinfo_api` driver replaces the dependency on the nrfx reset reason helper (see the :c:func:`nrfx_reset_reason_get` and :c:func:`nrfx_reset_reason_clear` functions).
  * The release configuration for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board target to enable the :ref:`nrf_desktop_failsafe` (see the :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_FAILSAFE_ENABLE <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option).
  * Enabled Link Time Optimization (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTO` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ISR_TABLES_LOCAL_DECLARATION`) by default for an nRF Desktop application image.
    LTO was also explicitly enabled in configurations of other images built by sysbuild (bootloader, network core image).
  * Application configurations for nRF54L05, nRF54L10, and nRF54L15 SoCs to use Fast Pair PSA cryptography (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_CRYPTO_PSA`).
    Using PSA cryptography improves security and reduces memory footprint.
    Also increased the size of the Bluetooth receiving thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_RX_STACK_SIZE`) to prevent stack overflows.
  * Application configurations for the nRF52820 SoC to reduce memory footprint:

    * Disabled Bluetooth long workqueue (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_LONG_WQ`).
    * Limited the number of key slots in the PSA Crypto core to 10 (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_KEY_SLOT_COUNT`).

  * Application configurations for HID peripherals by increasing the following thread stack sizes to prevent stack overflows during the :c:func:`settings_load` operation:

    * The system workqueue thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SYSTEM_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE`).
    * The CAF settings loader thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_SETTINGS_LOADER_THREAD_STACK_SIZE`).

    This change results from the Bluetooth subsystem transition to the PSA cryptographic API.
    The GATT database hash calculation now requires larger stack size.

  * Support for Bluetooth LE legacy pairing is no longer enabled by default, because it is not secure.
    Using Bluetooth LE legacy pairing introduces, among others, a risk of passive eavesdropping.
    Supporting Bluetooth LE legacy pairing makes devices vulnerable for a downgrade attack.
    The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SMP_SC_PAIR_ONLY` Kconfig option is enabled by default in Zephyr.
    If you still need to support the Bluetooth LE legacy pairing, you need to disable the option in the configuration.
  * :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_state` and :ref:`nrf_desktop_fn_keys` to use :c:func:`bsearch` implementation from C library.
    This simplifies maintenance and allows you to use Picolibc (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PICOLIBC`).
  * The IPC radio image configurations of the nRF5340 DK to use Picolibc (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PICOLIBC`).
    This aligns the configurations to the IPC radio image configurations of the nRF54H20 DK.
    Picolibc is used by default in Zephyr.
  * The nRF Desktop application image configurations to use Picolibc (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PICOLIBC`) by default.
    Using the minimal libc implementation (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MINIMAL_LIBC`) no longer decreases the memory footprint of the application image for most of the configurations.
  * Enabled :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state_sof_synchronization` (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_USB_HID_REPORT_SENT_ON_SOF <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option) by default on the nRF54H Series SoC (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_SERIES_NRF54HX`).
    The negative impact of USB polling jitter is more visible in case of USB High-Speed.
  * The Fast Pair sysbuild configurations to align the application with the sysbuild Kconfig changes for controlling the Fast Pair provisioning process.
    The Nordic device models intended for demonstration purposes are now supplied by default in the nRF Desktop Fast Pair configurations.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_dvfs` to no longer consume the :c:struct:`ble_peer_conn_params_event`.
    This allows to propagate the event to further listeners of the same or lower priority.
    This prevents an issue where :ref:`nrf_desktop_ble_latency` is not informed about the connection parameter update (it might cause missing connection latency updates).

* Removed:

  * An imply from the nRF Desktop Bluetooth connectivity Kconfig option (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BT <config_desktop_app_options>`).
    The imply enabled a separate workqueue for connection TX notify processing (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CONN_TX_NOTIFY_WQ`) if MPSL was used for synchronization between the flash memory driver and the radio (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_RADIO_SYNC_MPSL`).
    The workaround for the MPSL flash synchronization issue (``NCSDK-29354`` in the :ref:`known_issues` page) is no longer needed, as the issue is now fixed.
  * Application configurations for the nRF52810 Desktop Mouse board (``nrf52810dmouse/nrf52810``).
    The board is no longer supported in the |NCS|.

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Serial LTE modem
----------------

* Added an overlay :file:`overlay-memfault.conf` file to enable Memfault.
  For more information about Memfault features in |NCS|, see :ref:`mod_memfault`.

* Updated:

  * The application to use the :ref:`lib_downloader` library instead of the deprecated :ref:`lib_download_client` library.
  * In Zephyr, the numerical values of various |NCS| specific socket options that are used with the ``#XSOCKETOPT`` command:

      * The :c:macro:`TLS_DTLS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEO` has been changed from ``18`` to ``1018``
      * The :c:macro:`SO_SILENCE_ALL` has been changed from ``30`` to ``1030``
      * The :c:macro:`SO_IP_ECHO_REPLY` has been changed from ``31`` to ``1031``
      * The :c:macro:`SO_IPV6_ECHO_REPLY` has been changed from ``32`` to ``1032``
      * The :c:macro:`SO_BINDTOPDN` has been changed from ``40`` to ``1040``
      * The :c:macro:`SO_TCP_SRV_SESSTIMEO` has been changed from ``55`` to ``1055``
      * The :c:macro:`SO_RAI` has been changed from ``61`` to ``1061``
      * The :c:macro:`SO_IPV6_DELAYED_ADDR_REFRESH` has been changed from ``62`` to ``1062``

Thingy:53: Matter weather station
---------------------------------

* Updated by enabling Link Time Optimization (LTO) by default for the ``release`` configuration.

---------------------------

* Added support for the ``nrf54l15dk/nrf54l05/cpuapp`` and ``nrf54l15dk/nrf54l10/cpuapp`` board targets in all Fast Pair samples.

* Updated:

  * The non-secure target (``nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns`` and ``thingy53/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns``) configurations of all Fast Pair samples to use configurable TF-M profile instead of the predefined minimal TF-M profile.
    This change results from the Bluetooth subsystem transition to the PSA cryptographic standard.
    The Bluetooth stack can now use the PSA crypto API in the non-secure domain as all necessary TF-M partitions are configured properly.
  * The configuration of all Fast Pair samples by increasing the following thread stack sizes to prevent stack overflows:

    * The system workqueue thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SYSTEM_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE`).
    * The Bluetooth receiving thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_RX_STACK_SIZE`).

    This change results from the Bluetooth subsystem transition to the PSA cryptographic API.
  * The sysbuild configurations in samples to align them with the sysbuild Kconfig changes for controlling the Fast Pair provisioning process.

* Removed using a separate workqueue for connection TX notify processing (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CONN_TX_NOTIFY_WQ`) from configurations.
  The MPSL flash synchronization issue (``NCSDK-29354`` in the :ref:`known_issues`) is fixed.
  The workaround is no longer needed.

* :ref:`fast_pair_locator_tag` sample:

  * Added support for the following:

    * :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board target.
    * Firmware update intents on the Android platform.
      Integrated the new connection authentication callback from the FMDN module and the Device Information Service (DIS) to support firmware version read operation over the Firmware Revision characteristic.
      For further details on the Android intent feature for firmware updates, see the :ref:`ug_bt_fast_pair_provisioning_register_firmware_update_intent` section of the Fast Pair integration guide.

  * Updated:

    * The partition layout for the ``nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns`` and ``thingy53/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns`` board targets to accommodate the partitions needed due to a change in the TF-M profile configuration.
    * The debug (default) configuration of the main image to enable the Link Time Optimization (LTO) with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTO` Kconfig option.
      This change ensures consistency with the sample release configuration that has the LTO feature enabled by default.

Libraries
=========

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`library <libraries>`.

Binary libraries
----------------

* :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library:

  * Updated the glue to use the :ref:`lib_downloader` library instead of the deprecated :ref:`lib_download_client` library.

Bluetooth libraries and services
--------------------------------

* :ref:`bt_fast_pair_readme` library:

  * Added:

    * A restriction on the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_FMDN_TX_POWER` Kconfig option in the Find My Device Network (FMDN) extension configuration.
      You must set this Kconfig option now to ``0`` at minimum as the Fast Pair specification requires that the conducted Bluetooth transmit power for FMDN advertisements must not be lower than 0 dBm.
    * A new information callback - :c:member:`bt_fast_pair_fmdn_info_cb.conn_authenticated` - to the FMDN extension API.
      In the FMDN context, this change is required to support firmware update intents on the Android platform.
      For further details on the Android intent feature for firmware updates, see the :ref:`ug_bt_fast_pair_provisioning_register_firmware_update_intent` section in the Fast Pair integration guide.
    * A workaround for the issue where the FMDN clock value might not be correctly set after the system reboot for nRF54L Series devices.
      For details, see the ``NCSDK-32268`` issue in the :ref:`known_issues` page.
    * A new function :c:func:`bt_fast_pair_fmdn_is_provisioned` for the FMDN extension API.
      This function can be used to synchronously check the current FMDN provisioning state.
      For more details, see the :ref:`ug_bt_fast_pair_gatt_service_fmdn_info_callbacks_provisioning_state` section in the Fast Pair integration guide.

  * Updated:

    * The :c:func:`bt_fast_pair_info_cb_register` API to allow registration of multiple callbacks.
    * The Fast Pair sysbuild Kconfig options.
      The ``SB_CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR`` Kconfig option is replaced with the ``SB_CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_MODEL_ID`` and ``SB_CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_ANTI_SPOOFING_PRIVATE_KEY``.
    * The method of supplying the Fast Pair Model ID and Anti-Spoofing Private Key to generate the Fast Pair provisioning data HEX file.
      The ``FP_MODEL_ID`` and ``FP_ANTI_SPOOFING_KEY`` CMake variables are replaced by the corresponding ``SB_CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_MODEL_ID`` and ``SB_CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_ANTI_SPOOFING_PRIVATE_KEY`` Kconfig options.
    * The automatically generated ``bt_fast_pair`` partition definition (in the :file:`subsys/partition_manager/pm.yml.bt_fast_pair` file) to work correctly when building with TF-M.
    * The behavior of the :c:member:`bt_fast_pair_fmdn_info_cb.provisioning_state_changed` callback.
      The callback no longer reports the initial provisioning state after the Fast Pair subsystem is enabled with the :c:func:`bt_fast_pair_enable` function call.
      See the :ref:`migration guide <migration_3.0_recommended>` for mandatory changes and the :ref:`ug_bt_fast_pair_gatt_service_fmdn_info_callbacks_provisioning_state` section in the Fast Pair integration guide for the description on how to track the FMDN provisioning state with the new approach.

  * Removed the sysbuild control over the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR` Kconfig option that is defined in the main (default) image.
    Sysbuild no longer sets the value of this Kconfig option.

* :ref:`bt_mesh` library:

  * Fixed an issue in the :ref:`bt_mesh_light_ctrl_srv_readme` model to automatically resume the Lightness Controller after recalling a scene (``NCSDK-30033`` known issue).

Common Application Framework
----------------------------

* :ref:`caf_buttons`:

  * Added possibility of using more GPIOs.
    Earlier, only **GPIO0** and **GPIO1** devices were supported.
    Now, the generic solution supports all GPIOs available in the DTS.

* :ref:`caf_power_manager`:

  * Updated:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_POWER_MANAGER` Kconfig option to imply the device power management (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DEVICE_PM`) instead of selecting it.
      The device power management is not required by the module.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_POWER_MANAGER` Kconfig option to imply device runtime power management (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME`) for the nRF54H Series SoC (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_SERIES_NRF54HX`).
      The feature can be used to reduce the power consumption of device drivers.
      Enabling the device runtime power management also prevents using system-managed device power management (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_SYSTEM_MANAGED`) by default.
      The system-managed device power management does not work properly with some drivers (for example, nrfx UARTE) and should be avoided.

Debug libraries
---------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

DFU libraries
-------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

* :ref:`lib_fmfu_fdev`:

  * Regenerated the zcbor-generated code files using v0.9.0.

Modem libraries
---------------

* Deprecated the :ref:`at_params_readme` library.

* :ref:`pdn_readme` library:

  * Deprecated the :c:func:`pdn_dynamic_params_get` function.
    Use the new function :c:func:`pdn_dynamic_info_get` instead.

* :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library:

  * Fixed handling of ``%NCELLMEAS`` notification with status 2 (measurement interrupted) and no cells.
  * Added sending of ``LTE_LC_EVT_NEIGHBOR_CELL_MEAS`` event with ``current_cell`` set to ``LTE_LC_CELL_EUTRAN_ID_INVALID`` in case an error occurs while parsing the ``%NCELLMEAS`` notification.

* :ref:`modem_key_mgmt` library:

  * Added:

    * The :c:func:`modem_key_mgmt_digest` function that would retrieve the SHA1 digest of a credential from the modem.
    * The :c:func:`modem_key_mgmt_list` function that would retrieve the security tag and type of every credential stored in the modem.

  * Fixed:

    * An issue with the :c:func:`modem_key_mgmt_clear` function where it returned ``-ENOENT`` when the credential was cleared.
    * A race condition in several functions where ``+CMEE`` error notifications could be disabled by one function before the other one got a chance to run its command.
    * An issue with the :c:func:`modem_key_mgmt_clear` function where ``+CMEE`` error notifications were not restored to their original state if the ``AT%CMNG`` AT command failed.
    * The :c:func:`modem_key_mgmt_clear` function to lock the shared scratch buffer.

* Updated the :ref:`nrf_modem_lib_lte_net_if` to automatically set the actual link :term:`Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)` on the network interface when PDN connectivity is gained.

* :ref:`nrf_modem_lib_readme`:

  * Fixed a bug where various subsystems would be erroneously initialized during a failed initialization of the library.

* :ref:`lib_location` library:

  * Removed references to HERE location services.

* :ref:`lib_at_host` library:

  * Fixed a bug where AT responses would erroneously be written to the logging UART instead of being written to the chosen ``ncs,at-host-uart`` UART device when the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_UART` Kconfig option was set.

* :ref:`modem_info_readme` library:

  * Added:

    * The :c:enum:`modem_info_data_type` type for representing LTE link information data types.
    * The :c:func:`modem_info_data_type_get` function for requesting the data type of the current modem information type.

  * Deprecated the :c:func:`modem_info_type_get` function in favor of the :c:func:`modem_info_data_type_get` function.

Multiprotocol Service Layer libraries
-------------------------------------

* Added:

  * Integration with the nrf2 clock control driver for the nRF54H20 SoC.
  * Integration with Zephyr's system power management for the nRF54H20 SoC.
  * Global domain HSFLL120 320MHz frequency request if MPSL is enabled.
    The high frequency in global domain is required to ensure that fetching instructions from L2-cache and MRAM is as fast as possible.
    It is needed for the radio protocols to operate correctly.
  * MRAM always-on request for scheduled radio events.
    It is needed to avoid MRAM wake-up latency for radio protocols.

Libraries for networking
------------------------

* Added:

  * The :ref:`lib_downloader` library.
  * A backend for the :ref:`TLS Credentials Subsystem <zephyr:sockets_tls_credentials_subsys>` that stores the credentials in the modem, see :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TLS_CREDENTIALS_BACKEND_NRF_MODEM`.

* Deprecated the :ref:`lib_download_client` library.
  See the :ref:`migration guide <migration_3.0_recommended>` for recommended changes.

* Updated the following libraries to use the :ref:`lib_downloader` library instead of the :ref:`lib_download_client` library:

  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud`
  * :ref:`lib_aws_fota`
  * :ref:`lib_azure_fota`
  * :ref:`lib_fota_download`

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_pgps` library:

  * Fixed the warning due to missing ``https`` download protocol.

* :ref:`lib_downloader` library:

  * Updated to support Proxy-URI option and an authentication callback after connecting.

* :ref:`lib_fota_download` library:

  * Added error codes related to unsupported protocol, DFU failures, and invalid configuration.
  * Updated to use the :ref:`lib_downloader` library for CoAP downloads.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:

  * Added the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD` Kconfig option to prevent unintended inclusion of nRF Cloud Kconfig variables in non-nRF Cloud projects.
  * Updated to use the :ref:`lib_downloader` library for CoAP downloads.

Scripts
=======

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`script <scripts>`.

* :ref:`nrf_desktop_config_channel_script`:

  * Removed HID device type mapping for Development Kits.
    A Development Kit may use various HID roles (depending on configuration).
    Assigning a fixed type for each board might be misleading.
    HID device type is still defined for boards that are always configured as the same HID device type.

Integrations
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`integration <integrations>`.

Google Fast Pair integration
----------------------------

* Added:

  * Information on how to support the firmware update intent feature on the Android platform.
    Expanded the documentation for the Fast Pair devices with the FMDN extension, which requires additional steps to support this feature.

* Updated:

  * The :ref:`ug_bt_fast_pair_provisioning_register_hex_generation` section that describes how to generate the hex file with the Fast Pair provisioning data.
  * The :ref:`ug_bt_fast_pair_prerequisite_ops_kconfig` section to align it with recent changes in the sysbuild configuration for Fast Pair.
