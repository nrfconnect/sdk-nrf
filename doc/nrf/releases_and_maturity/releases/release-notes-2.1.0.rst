    This affects applications and samples based on nRF9160.

* Added :ref:`modem_trace_backend_sample` sample, demonstrating how to add a custom modem trace backend.
  The custom backend prints the amount of trace data received in bytes, trace data throughput, and CPU load.
* Updated samples that support Thingy:91 to use :ref:`TF-M <ug_tfm>` enabled by default.
* Removed the AWS FOTA sample.
  The :ref:`aws_iot` sample must be used, which implements :ref:`lib_aws_fota` through :ref:`lib_aws_iot`.

Other libraries
---------------

* Added:

  * Documentation for the :ref:`lib_adp536x` library.
  * Documentation for the :ref:`lib_flash_map_pm` library.
  * :ref:`lib_identity_key` library.

* :ref:`lib_flash_patch` library:

Common Application Framework (CAF)
----------------------------------

* :ref:`caf_ble_adv`:

  * Added:

    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_BLE_ADV_FILTER_ACCEPT_LIST` Kconfig option.
      The option is used instead of :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FILTER_ACCEPT_LIST` option to enable the filter accept list.
    * :c:struct:`ble_adv_data_update_event` that can be used to trigger update of advertising data and scan response data during undirected advertising.
      When the event is received, the module gets new data from providers and updates advertising payload.
    * A wakeup call when connection is made in the grace period.
      With this change, the call wakes up the whole system to avoid inconsistent power state between modules.

  * Updated:

    * The :ref:`bt_le_adv_prov_readme` subsystem is now used instead of the :file:`*.def` file to configure advertising data and scan response data.
    * Bluetooth device name is no longer automatically included in scan response data.
      A dedicated data provider (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_DEVICE_NAME`) can be used to add the Bluetooth device name to the scan response data.

* :ref:`caf_ble_state`:

  * Updated to no longer automatically send security request immediately after Bluetooth LE connection is established when running on Bluetooth Peripheral.
    The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_BLE_STATE_SECURITY_REQ` Kconfig option can be used to enable this feature.
    The option can be used for both Bluetooth Peripheral and Bluetooth Central.

* :ref:`caf_sensor_data_aggregator`:

  * Added unit tests for the library.

* :ref:`caf_sensor_manager`:

  * Updated to no longer use floats to calculate and determine if the sensor trigger is activated.
    This is because the float uses more space.
    Also, data sent to :c:struct:`sensor_event` uses :c:struct:`sensor_value` instead of float.

Libraries for Zigbee
--------------------

* :ref:`lib_zigbee_application_utilities` library:

  * Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_PANID_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION` for enabling automatic PAN ID conflict resolution.
    This option is enabled by default.
