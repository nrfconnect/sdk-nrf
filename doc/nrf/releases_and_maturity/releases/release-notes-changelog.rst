Protocols
=========

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`protocol <protocols>`.
See `Samples`_ for lists of changes for the protocol-related samples.

BluetoothÂ® LE
-------------

* Added host extensions for Nordic-only vendor-specific command APIs.
  Implementation and integration of the host APIs can be found in the :file:`host_extensions.h` header file.

Bluetooth Mesh
--------------

* Updated:

  * :ref:`bt_mesh_dm_srv_readme` and :ref:`bt_mesh_dm_cli_readme` model IDs and opcodes have been updated to avoid conflict with Simple OnOff Server and Client models.
  * :ref:`bt_mesh_sensors_readme` now use an updated API with sensor values represented by :c:struct:`bt_mesh_sensor_value` instead of :c:struct:`sensor_value`.
    This makes it possible to accurately represent all encodable sensor values.
    The old APIs based on the :c:struct:`sensor_value` type are deprecated, but are still available for backward compatibility, and can be enabled for use by setting the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_SENSOR_USE_LEGACY_SENSOR_VALUE` Kconfig option.
  * :ref:`bt_mesh_ug_reserved_ids` with model ID and opcodes for the new :ref:`bt_mesh_le_pair_resp_readme` model.
  * :ref:`bt_mesh_light_ctrl_readme` APIs to match new Sensor APIs.
  * :ref:`ug_bt_mesh_configuring` with the recommendation on how to configure persistent storage to increase performance.

Matter
------

* For devices that use Matter over Thread, the default cryptography backend is now Arm PSA Crypto API instead of Mbed TLS, which was used in earlier versions.
  You can still build all examples with deprecated Mbed TLS support by setting the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_CRYPTO_PSA` Kconfig option to ``n``, but you must build the Thread libraries from sources.
  To :ref:`inherit Thread certification <ug_matter_device_certification_reqs_dependent>` from Nordic Semiconductor, you must use the PSA Crypto API backend.
* Updated the page about :ref:`ug_matter_device_low_power_configuration` with the information about Intermittently Connected Devices (ICD) configuration.

* Added:

  * A Kconfig option for disabling or enabling :ref:`ug_matter_configuring_read_client`.
  * Support for PSA Crypto API for devices that use Matter over Thread.
    It is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_CRYPTO_PSA` Kconfig option to ``n``.
  * :file:`VERSION` file implementation to manage versioning for DFU over SMP as well as also Matter OTA.
    Backward compatibility is maintained for users who use the :file:`prj.conf` file for versioning.
  * Migration of the Device Attestation Certificate (DAC) private key from the factory data set to the PSA ITS secure storage.

    The DAC private key can be removed from the factory data set after the migration.
    You can enable this experimental functionality by setting the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_CRYPTO_PSA_MIGRATE_DAC_PRIV_KEY` Kconfig option to ``y``.
  * Redefinition of thermostat sample measurement process, deleted :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_THERMOSTAT_EXTERNAL_SENSOR`.
    By default, the thermostat sample generates simulated temperature measurements.
    The generated measurements simulate local temperature changes.
    Additionally, you can enable periodic outdoor temperature measurements by binding the thermostat with an external temperature sensor device.

  * Migration of the Node Operational Key Pair (NOK) from the generic Matter persistent storage to the PSA ITS secure storage.
    All existing NOKs for all Matter fabrics will be migrated to the PSA ITS secure storage at boot.
    After the migration, generic Matter persistent storage entries in the settings storage will be removed and no longer available.
    To enable operational keys migration, set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NCS_SAMPLE_MATTER_OPERATIONAL_KEYS_MIGRATION_TO_ITS` Kconfig option to ``y``.

    In |NCS| Matter samples, the default reaction to migration failure is a factory reset of the device.
    To change the default reaction, set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NCS_SAMPLE_MATTER_FACTORY_RESET_ON_KEY_MIGRATION_FAILURE` Kconfig option to ``n``.

Matter fork
+++++++++++

The Matter fork in the |NCS| (``sdk-connectedhomeip``) contains all commits from the upstream Matter repository up to, and including, the ``v1.2.0.1`` tag.

The following list summarizes the most important changes inherited from the upstream Matter:

* Added:

   * Support for the Intermittently Connected Devices (ICD) Management cluster.
   * The Kconfig options :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ICD_IDLE_MODE_DURATION`, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ICD_ACTIVE_MODE_DURATION` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ICD_CLIENTS_PER_FABRIC` to manage ICD configuration.
   * New device types:

     * Refridgerator
     * Room air conditioner
     * Dishwasher
     * Laundry washer
     * Robotic vacuum cleaner
     * Smoke CO alarm
     * Air quality sensor
     * Air purifier
     * Fan

   * Product Appearance attribute in the Basic Information cluster that allows describing the product's color and finish.

* Updated:

   * Renamed the ``CONFIG_CHIP_ENABLE_SLEEPY_END_DEVICE_SUPPORT`` Kconfig option to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ENABLE_ICD_SUPPORT`.
   * Renamed the ``CONFIG_CHIP_SED_IDLE_INTERVAL`` Kconfig option to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ICD_SLOW_POLL_INTERVAL`.
   * Renamed the ``CONFIG_CHIP_SED_ACTIVE_INTERVAL`` Kconfig option to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ICD_FAST_POLLING_INTERVAL`.
   * Renamed the ``CONFIG_CHIP_SED_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD`` Kconfig option to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ICD_ACTIVE_MODE_THRESHOLD`.

Thread
------

* The default cryptography backend for Thread is now Arm PSA Crypto API instead of Mbed TLS, which was used in earlier versions.
  You can still build all examples with deprecated Mbed TLS support by setting the :kconfig:option:`OPENTHREAD_NRF_SECURITY_CHOICE` Kconfig option to ``y``, but you must build the Thread libraries from sources.
  To :ref:`inherit Thread certification <ug_thread_cert_inheritance_without_modifications>` from Nordic Semiconductor, you must use the PSA Crypto API backend.

See `Thread samples`_ for the list of changes for the Thread samples.

Zigbee
------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Gazell
------

* Added:

  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_GAZELL_PAIRING_USER_CONFIG_ENABLE` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_GAZELL_PAIRING_USER_CONFIG_FILE`.
    The options allow to use user-specific file as Gazell pairing configuration header to override the pairing configuration.

* Fixed:

  * Clear system address and host id in RAM when :c:func:`gzp_erase_pairing_data` is called.

Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB)
-------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

Asset Tracker v2
----------------

* Added:

  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DATA_SAMPLE_WIFI_DEFAULT` Kconfig option to configure whether Wi-Fi APs are included in sample requests by default.
  * The :kconfig:option:`NRF_CLOUD_SEND_SERVICE_INFO_FOTA` and :kconfig:option:`NRF_CLOUD_SEND_SERVICE_INFO_UI` Kconfig options.
    The application no longer sends a device shadow update; this is now handled by the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library.

* Updated:

  * The following power optimizations to the LwM2M configuration overlay:

    * Enable DTLS Connection Identifier.
    * Perform LwM2M update once an hour and request for similar update interval of periodic tracking area from the LTE network.
    * Request the same active time as the QUEUE mode polling time.
    * Enable eDRX with shortest possible interval and a short paging window.
    * Enable tickless mode in the LwM2M engine.
    * Enable LTE Release Assist Indicator.

* Removed the nRF7002 EK devicetree overlay file :file:`nrf91xxdk_with_nrf7002ek.overlay`, because UART1 is disabled through the shield configuration.

Serial LTE modem
----------------

* Added:

  * ``#XMQTTCFG`` AT command to configure MQTT client before connecting to the broker.
  * The :ref:`CONFIG_SLM_AUTO_CONNECT <CONFIG_SLM_AUTO_CONNECT>` Kconfig option to support automatic LTE connection at start-up or reset.
  * The :ref:`CONFIG_SLM_CUSTOMER_VERSION <CONFIG_SLM_CUSTOMER_VERSION>` Kconfig option for customers to define their own version string after customization.
  * The optional ``path`` parameter to the ``#XCARRIEREVT`` AT notification.
  * ``#XCARRIERCFG`` AT command to configure the LwM2M carrier library using the LwM2M carrier settings (see the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_CARRIER_SETTINGS` Kconfig option).

* Updated:

  * ``#XSLMVER`` AT command to report CONFIG_SLM_CUSTOMER_VERSION if it is defined.
  * The ``#XTCPCLI``, ``#XUDPCLI`` and ``#XHTTPCCON`` AT commands with options to:

    * Set the ``PEER_VERIFY`` socket option.
      Set to ``TLS_PEER_VERIFY_REQUIRED`` by default.
    * Set the ``TLS_HOSTNAME`` socket option to ``NULL`` to disable the hostname verification.

  * Allow building the application for nRF9160 DK board revision older than 0.14.0.
  * ``#XCMNG`` AT command to store credentials in Zephyr settings storage.
    The command is activated with the :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` overlay file.

* Removed Kconfig options ``CONFIG_SLM_CUSTOMIZED`` and ``CONFIG_SLM_SOCKET_RX_MAX``.

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

* Updated:

  * ISO data sending has been refactored, and is now done in a single file: bt_le_audio_tx.
  * Split the generic applications into their own samples with separate main.c files


nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

* Updated:

  * The MCUboot and HCI RPMsg child images debug configurations to disable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_RESET_ON_FATAL_ERROR` Kconfig option.
    Disabling this Kconfig option improves the debugging experience.
  * The MCUboot and HCI RPMsg child images release configurations to explicitly enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_RESET_ON_FATAL_ERROR` Kconfig option.
    Enabling this Kconfig option improves the reliability of the firmware.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Updated:

  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu` to use :ref:`partition_manager` definitions for determining currently booted image slot in build time.
    The other image slot is used to store an application update image.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu_mcumgr` to use MCUmgr SMP command status callbacks (the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_SMP_COMMAND_STATUS_HOOKS` Kconfig option) instead of MCUmgr image and OS management callbacks.
  * The dependencies of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_LOW_LATENCY_LOCK` Kconfig option.
    The option can be enabled even when the Bluetooth controller is not enabled as part of the application that uses :ref:`nrf_desktop_ble_latency`.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_bootloader` and :ref:`nrf_desktop_bootloader_background_dfu` sections in the nRF Desktop documentation to explicitly mention the supported DFU configurations.
  * The documentation describing the :ref:`nrf_desktop_memory_layout` configuration to simplify the process of getting started with the application.
  * Changed the term *flash memory* to *non-volatile memory* for generalization purposes.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_watchdog` to use ``watchdog0`` DTS alias instead of ``wdt`` DTS node label.
    Using the alias makes the configuration of the module more flexible.
  * Introduced information about priority, pipeline depth and maximum number of HID reports to :c:struct:`hid_report_subscriber_event`.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_state` uses :c:struct:`hid_report_subscriber_event` to handle HID data subscribers connection and disconnection.
    The :c:struct:`ble_peer_event` and ``usb_hid_event`` are no longer used for this purpose.
  * The ``usb_hid_event`` is removed.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state` to use the :c:func:`usb_hid_set_proto_code` function to set the HID Boot Interface protocol code.
    The ``CONFIG_USB_HID_BOOT_PROTOCOL`` Kconfig option was removed and dedicated API needs to be used instead.
  * Disabled MCUboot's logs over RTT (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_RTT` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT`) on ``nrf52840dk_nrf52840`` in :file:`prj_mcuboot_qspi.conf` configuration to reduce MCUboot memory footprint and avoid flash overflows.
    Explicitly enabled the UART log backend (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_UART`) together with its dependencies in the configuration file to ensure log visibility.
  * The MCUboot, B0, and HCI RPMsg child images debug configurations to disable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_RESET_ON_FATAL_ERROR` Kconfig option.
    Disabling this Kconfig option improves the debugging experience.
  * The MCUboot, B0, and HCI RPMsg child images release configurations to explicitly enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_RESET_ON_FATAL_ERROR` Kconfig option.
    Enabling this Kconfig option improves the reliability of the firmware.

* Added the :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_HID_STATE_SUBSCRIBER_COUNT <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option to the :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_state`.
  The option allows to configure a maximum number of simultaneously supported HID data subscribers.
  By default, the value of this Kconfig option is set to ``1``.
  Make sure to align the value in your application configuration.
  For example, to allow subscribing for HID reports simultaneously from :ref:`nrf_desktop_hids` and :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state` (a single USB HID instance), you must set the value of this Kconfig option to ``2``.

Thingy:53: Matter weather station
---------------------------------

* Removed instantiation of OTATestEventTriggerDelegate, which was usable only for Matter Test Event purposes.
* Changed the deployment of configuration files to align with other Matter applications.

Matter Bridge
-------------

* Added:

  * Support for groupcast communication to the On/Off Light device implementation.
  * Support for controlling the OnOff Light simulated data provider by using shell commands.
  * Support for Matter Generic Switch bridged device type.
  * Support for On/Off Light Switch bridged device type.
  * Support for bindings to the On/Off Light Switch device implementation.
  * Guide about extending the application by adding support for a new Matter device type, a new Bluetooth LE service or a new protocol.
  * Support for Bluetooth LE Security Manager Protocol that allows to establish secure session with bridged Bluetooth LE devices.

Samples
=======

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`sample <samples>`.

Bluetooth samples
-----------------

* :ref:`ble_throughput` sample:

  * Enabled encryption in the sample.
    The measured throughput is calculated over the encrypted data, which is how most of the Bluetooth products use this protocol.

* :ref:`direct_test_mode` sample:

  * Added the configuration option to disable the Direction Finding feature.

Bluetooth Mesh samples
----------------------

* :ref:`ble_mesh_dfu_distributor` sample:

  * Added:

    * Support for pairing with display capability and the :ref:`bt_mesh_le_pair_resp_readme`.

  * Fixed:

    * An issue where the shell interface was not accessible over UART because UART was used as a transport for MCUmgr SMP protocol.
      Shell is now accessible over RTT.

Cellular samples
----------------

* :ref:`ciphersuites` sample:

  * Updated:

    * The format of the :file:`.pem` file to the pem format.
    * The sample to automatically convert the :file:`.pem` file to hex format so it can be included.

* :ref:`location_sample` sample:

  * Removed the nRF7002 EK devicetree overlay file :file:`nrf91xxdk_with_nrf7002ek.overlay`, because UART1 is disabled through the shield configuration.

* :ref:`modem_shell_application` sample:

  * Added:

    * Support for full modem FOTA.
    * Printing of the last reset reason when the sample starts.
    * Support for printing the sample version information using the ``version`` command.
    * Support for counting pulses from a GPIO pin using the ``gpio_count`` command.
    * Support for changing shell UART baudrate using the ``uart baudrate`` command.
    * Support for DNS query using the ``sock getaddrinfo`` command.
    * Support for PDN CID 0 in the ``-I`` argument for the ``sock connect`` command.
    * Support for listing interface addresses using the ``link ifaddrs`` command.

  * Removed the nRF7002 EK devicetree overlay file :file:`nrf91xxdk_with_nrf7002ek.overlay`, because UART1 is disabled through the shield configuration.

  * Updated:

    * The MQTT and CoAP overlays to enable the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_SEND_SERVICE_INFO_UI`.
      The sample no longer sends a device shadow update for MQTT and CoAP builds; this is now handled by the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library.
    * To use the new :c:struct:`nrf_cloud_location_config` structure when calling the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_location_request` function.
    * The ``connect`` subcommand to use the :c:func:`connect` function on non-secure datagram sockets.
      This sets the peer address for the non-secure datagram socket.
      This fixes a bug where using the ``connect`` subcommand and then using the ``rai_no_data`` option with the ``rai`` subcommand on a non-secure datagram socket would lead to an error.
      The ``rai_no_data`` option requires the socket to be connected and have a peer address set.
      This bug is caused by the non-secure datagram socket not being connected when using the ``connect`` subcommand.
    * The ``send`` subcommand to use the :c:func:`send` function for non-secure datagram sockets that are connected and have a peer address set.

* :ref:`nrf_cloud_multi_service` sample:

  * Added:

    * A generic processing example for application-specific shadow data.
    * Configuration and overlay files to enable MCUboot to use the external flash on the nRF1961 DK.
    * A :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_COAP_ALWAYS_CONFIRM` Kconfig option to select CON or NON CoAP transfers for functions that previously used NON transfers only.
    * Support for the :ref:`lib_nrf_provisioning` library.
    * An overlay file :file:`overlay-coap_nrf_provisioning.conf` to enable the :ref:`lib_nrf_provisioning` library with CoAP connectivity.

  * Fixed:

    * The sample now waits for a successful connection before printing ``Connected to nRF Cloud!``.
    * Building for the Thingy:91.
    * The PSM Requested Active Time is now reduced from 1 minute to 20 seconds.
      The old value was too long for PSM to activate.

  * Changed:

    * The sample now explicitly uses the :c:func:`conn_mgr_all_if_connect` function to start network connectivity, instead of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_NET_IF_AUTO_START` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_NET_IF_AUTO_CONNECT` Kconfig options.
    * The sample to use the FOTA support functions in the :file:`nrf_cloud_fota_poll.c` and :file:`nrf_cloud_fota_common.c` files.
    * The sample now enables the Kconfig options :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_SEND_SERVICE_INFO_FOTA` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_SEND_SERVICE_INFO_UI`.
      It no longer sends a device status update on initial connection; this is now handled by the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library.
    * Increased the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_AT_HOST_STACK_SIZE` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_AT_MONITOR_HEAP_SIZE` Kconfig options to 2048 bytes since nRF Cloud credentials are sometimes longer than 1024 bytes.
    * The sample reboot logic is now in a dedicated file so that it can be used in multiple locations.
    * The Wi-Fi connectivity overlay now uses the PSA Protected Storage backend of the :ref:`TLS Credentials Subsystem <zephyr:sockets_tls_credentials_subsys>` instead of the volatile backend.
    * The Wi-Fi connectivity overlay now enables the :ref:`TLS Credentials Shell <zephyr:tls_credentials_shell>` for run-time credential installation.

  * Removed the nRF7002 EK devicetree overlay file :file:`nrf91xxdk_with_nrf7002ek.overlay`, because UART1 is disabled through the shield configuration.

* :ref:`nrf_cloud_rest_fota` sample:

  * Added credential check before connecting to network.
  * Changed the sample use the functions in the :file:`nrf_cloud_fota_poll.c` and :file:`nrf_cloud_fota_common.c` files.
  * Increased the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_AT_HOST_STACK_SIZE` Kconfig option to 2048 bytes since nRF Cloud credentials are sometimes longer than 1024 bytes.

* :ref:`nrf_cloud_rest_cell_pos_sample` sample:

  * Increased the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_AT_HOST_STACK_SIZE` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_AT_MONITOR_HEAP_SIZE` Kconfig options to 2048 bytes since nRF Cloud credentials are sometimes longer than 1024 bytes.

  * Added:

    * Credential check before connecting to network.
    * Use of the :c:struct:`nrf_cloud_location_config` structure to modify the ground fix results.

* :ref:`nrf_provisioning_sample` sample:

  * Added event handling for events from device mode callback.

* :ref:`gnss_sample` sample:

  * Added the configuration overlay file :file:`overlay-supl.conf` for building the sample with SUPL assistance support.

* :ref:`udp` sample:

  * Added the :ref:`CONFIG_UDP_DATA_UPLOAD_ITERATIONS <CONFIG_UDP_DATA_UPLOAD_ITERATIONS>` Kconfig option for configuring the number of data transmissions to the server.

* :ref:`lwm2m_carrier` sample:

  * Updated:

    * The format of the :file:`.pem` files to the pem format.
    * The sample to automatically convert the :file:`.pem` files to hex format so they can be included.

* :ref:`lwm2m_client` sample:

  * Added:

    * A workaround for ground fix location assistance queries in AVSystem Coiote by using fixed Connectivity Monitor object version.
      This is enabled in the :file:`overlay-assist-cell.conf` configuration overlay.
    * Release Assistance Indication (RAI) feature.
      This helps to save power by releasing the network connection faster on a network that supports it.

  * Updated:

    * The eDRX cycle to 5.12 s for both LTE-M and NB-IoT.
    * The periodic TAU (RPTAU) to 12 hours.

Cryptography samples
--------------------

* Updated:

  * All crypto samples to use ``psa_key_id_t`` instead of ``psa_key_handle_t``.
    These concepts have been merged and ``psa_key_handle_t`` is removed from the PSA API specification.

  * Moved common methods for managing buttons and LEDs that are located on the DK to the board module.
  * Divided events to application and system events.
  * Defined common LED and button constants in the dedicated board configuration files.
  * Created the Kconfig file for the Matter common directory.

* Disabled :ref:`ug_matter_configuring_read_client` in most Matter samples using the new :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ENABLE_READ_CLIENT` Kconfig option.

* :ref:`matter_light_bulb_sample` sample:

  * Added support for `AWS IoT Core`_.

* :ref:`matter_template_sample` sample:

  * Added support for DFU over Bluetooth LE SMP.
    The functionality is disabled by default.
    To enable it, set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_DFU_OVER_BT_SMP` Kconfig option to ``y``.

* :ref:`matter_lock_sample` sample:

  * Fixed an issue that prevented nRF Toolbox for iOS in version 5.0.9 from controlling the sample using :ref:`nus_service_readme`.
  * Changed the design of the :ref:`matter_lock_sample_wifi_thread_switching` feature so that support for both Matter over Thread and Matter over Wi-Fi is included in a single firmware image.

* Disabled:

  * :ref:`ug_matter_configuring_read_client` in most Matter samples using the new :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ENABLE_READ_CLIENT` Kconfig option.
  * WPA Supplicant advanced features in all Matter samples using the :kconfig:option:`WPA_SUPP_ADVANCED_FEATURES` Kconfig option.
    This saves roughly 25 KB of FLASH memory for firmware images with Wi-Fi support.

|no_changes_yet_note|

DFU libraries
-------------

* :ref:`lib_dfu_target` library:

  * Updated:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DFU_TARGET_FULL_MODEM_USE_EXT_PARTITION` Kconfig option to be automatically enabled when ``nordic,pm-ext-flash`` is chosen in the devicetree.

Modem libraries
---------------

* :ref:`lib_location` library:

  * Added:

    * The :c:enumerator:`LOCATION_EVT_STARTED` event to indicate that location request has been started.
      This is for metrics collection purposes and sent only if the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOCATION_DATA_DETAILS` Kconfig option is set.
    * Support for multiple event handlers.

  * Updated:

    * The use of neighbor cell measurements for cellular positioning.
      Previously, 1-2 searches were performed and now 1-3 will be done depending on the requested number of cells and the number of found cells.
      Also, only GCI cells are counted towards the requested number of cells, and normal neighbors are ignored from this perspective.
    * Cellular positioning not to use GCI search when the device is in RRC connected mode, because the modem cannot search for GCI cells in that mode.
    * GNSS is not started at all if the device does not enter RRC idle mode within two minutes.

* :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library:

  * Added:

    * The :c:func:`lte_lc_psm_param_set_seconds` function and Kconfig options :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_PSM_REQ_FORMAT`, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_PSM_REQ_RPTAU_SECONDS`, and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_PSM_REQ_RAT_SECONDS` to enable setting of PSM parameters in seconds instead of using bit field strings.

  * Updated:

    * The default network mode to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_NETWORK_MODE_LTE_M_NBIOT_GPS` from :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_NETWORK_MODE_LTE_M_GPS`.
    * The default LTE mode preference to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_MODE_PREFERENCE_LTE_M_PLMN_PRIO` from :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_MODE_PREFERENCE_AUTO`.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_NETWORK_USE_FALLBACK` Kconfig option is deprecated.
      Use the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_NETWORK_MODE_LTE_M_NBIOT` or :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_NETWORK_MODE_LTE_M_NBIOT_GPS` Kconfig option instead.
      In addition, you can control the priority between LTE-M and NB-IoT using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_MODE_PREFERENCE` Kconfig option.
    * The :c:func:`lte_lc_init` function is deprecated.
    * The :c:func:`lte_lc_deinit` function is deprecated.

    * The :c:func:`lte_lc_init_and_connect` function is deprecated.
      Use the :c:func:`lte_lc_connect` function instead.
    * The :c:func:`lte_lc_init_and_connect_async` function is deprecated.
      Use the :c:func:`lte_lc_connect_async` function instead.

    * A mention about enabling TF-M logging while using modem traces in the :ref:`modem_trace_module`.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_NET_IF_DOWN_DEFAULT_LTE_DISCONNECT` option, allowing the user to change the behavior of the driver's :c:func:`net_if_down` implementation at build time.

  * Updated by renaming ``lte_connectivity`` module to ``lte_net_if``.
    All related Kconfig options have been renamed accordingly.
  * Changed the default value of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_NET_IF_AUTO_START`, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_NET_IF_AUTO_CONNECT`, and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_NET_IF_AUTO_DOWN` Kconfig options from enabled to disabled.

  * Fixed:

    * The ``lte_net_if`` module now handles the :c:enumerator:`~pdn_event.PDN_EVENT_NETWORK_DETACH` PDN event.
      Not handling this caused permanent connection loss and error message (``ipv4_addr_add, error: -19``) in some situations when reconnecting.

* :ref:`lib_at_host` library:

  * Added the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_AT_HOST_STACK_SIZE` Kconfig option.
    This option allows the stack size of the AT host workqueue thread to be adjusted.

* :ref:`modem_key_mgmt` library:

  * Fixed a potential race condition, where two threads might corrupt a shared response buffer.

Libraries for networking
------------------------

* :ref:`lib_aws_iot` library:

  * Added library tests.
  * Updated the library to use the :ref:`lib_mqtt_helper` library.
    This simplifies the handling of the MQTT stack.

* :ref:`lib_download_client` library:

  * Added:

    * The ``family`` parameter to the :c:struct:`download_client_cfg` structure.

-----------------

* Fixed an issue with handling zero size data (when receiving empty I-blocks from poller) in the :file:`platform_internal_thread` file.

nRF Security
------------

* Updated the library to no longer enable RSA keys by default.
  This reduces the code size by 30 kB for those that are not using RSA keys.
  This will also break the configuration for those using the RSA keys without explicitly enabling an RSA key size.
  Enable the required key size to fix the configuration, for example by setting the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_WANT_RSA_KEY_SIZE_2048` if 2048-bit RSA keys are required.

* The PSA config is now validated by ncs/nrf/ext/oberon/psa/core/library/check_crypto_config.h.
  Users with invalid configurations must update their PSA configuration according to the error messages that check_crypto_config.h provides.


Other libraries
---------------

* :ref:`lib_adp536x` library:

  * Fixed issue where the adp536x driver was included in the immutable bootloader on Thingy:91 when :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT` was enabled.

* :ref:`mod_memfault` library:

  * Added more default LTE metrics, such as band, operator, RSRP, and kilobytes sent and received.
  * Updated the default metric names to follow the standard |NCS| variable name convention.

Common Application Framework (CAF)
----------------------------------

* :ref:`caf_ble_state`:

  * Updated the dependencies of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_BLE_USE_LLPM` Kconfig option.
    The option can be enabled even when the Bluetooth controller is not enabled as part of the application that uses :ref:`caf_ble_state`.
