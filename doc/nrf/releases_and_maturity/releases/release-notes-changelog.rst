Bluetooth Mesh
--------------

* Updated:

  * The Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_DFU_METADATA_ON_BUILD` to no longer depend on the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_DFU_METADATA`.
  * The Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_DFU_CLI` to no longer enable the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_DFU_METADATA_ON_BUILD` by default.
    The Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_DFU_METADATA_ON_BUILD` can still be manually enabled.

Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

Asset Tracker v2
----------------

* Updated:

  * The MQTT topic name for A-GNSS requests is changed to ``agnss`` for AWS and Azure backends.

Serial LTE modem
----------------

* Removed mention of Termite and Teraterm terminal emulators from the documentation.
  The recommended approach is to use one of the emulators listed on the :ref:`test_and_optimize` page.

* Updated:

  * AT command parsing to utilize the :ref:`at_cmd_custom_readme` library.

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

* Updated the ``ml_runner`` application module to allow running a machine learning model without anomaly support.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Added:

  * Support for the nRF54L15 PDK with the ``nrf54l15pdk_nrf54l15_cpuapp`` board target.
    The PDK can act as a sample mouse or keyboard.
    It supports the Bluetooth LE HID data transport and uses SoftDevice Link Layer with Low Latency Packet Mode (LLPM) enabled.
  * The ``nrfdesktop-wheel-qdec`` DT alias support to :ref:`nrf_desktop_wheel`.
    You must use the alias to specify the QDEC instance used for scroll wheel, if your board supports multiple QDEC instances (for example ``nrf54l15pdk_nrf54l15_cpuapp``).
    You do not need to define the alias if your board supports only one QDEC instance, because in that case, the wheel module can rely on the ``qdec`` DT label provided by the board.

* Updated the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_TX_POWER_CORRECTION_VAL` Kconfig option value in the nRF52840 Gaming Mouse configurations with the Fast Pair support.
  The value is now aligned with the Fast Pair requirements.

Thingy:53: Matter weather station
---------------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Matter Bridge
-------------

* Added:

   The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BRIDGE_BT_MAX_SCANNED_DEVICES` kconfig option to set the maximum number of scanned Bluetooth LE devices.
   The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BRIDGE_BT_SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS` kconfig option to set the scan timeout.

Modem libraries
---------------

* :ref:`nrf_modem_lib_readme`:

Libraries for networking
------------------------

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:
