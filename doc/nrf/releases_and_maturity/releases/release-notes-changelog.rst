----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Asset Tracker v2
----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Connectivity Bridge
-------------------

-----------

* Updated:

  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_settings_loader` to make the :ref:`Zephyr Memory Storage (ZMS) <zephyr:zms_api>` the default settings backend for all board targets that use the MRAM technology.
    As a result, all :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` configurations were migrated from the NVS settings backend to the ZMS settings backend.
  * The :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` release configuration to enable the :ref:`nrf_desktop_watchdog`.
  * The configuration files of the :ref:`nrf_desktop_click_detector` (:file:`click_detector_def.h`) to allow using them also when Bluetooth LE peer control using a dedicated button (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_PEER_CONTROL <config_desktop_app_options>`) is disabled.

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Samples
=======

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`sample <samples>`.

Amazon Sidewalk samples
-----------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Bluetooth samples
-----------------

* Added:

  * The :ref:`channel_sounding_ras_reflector` sample demonstrating how to implement a Channel Sounding Reflector that exposes the Ranging Responder GATT Service.

* Updated:

  * Configurations of the following Bluetooth samples to make the :ref:`Zephyr Memory Storage (ZMS) <zephyr:zms_api>` the default settings backend for all board targets that use the MRAM technology:

      * :ref:`bluetooth_central_hids`
      * :ref:`peripheral_hids_keyboard`
      * :ref:`peripheral_hids_mouse`

    As a result, all :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` configurations of the affected samples were migrated from the NVS settings backend to the ZMS settings backend.
  * Testing steps in the :ref:`peripheral_hids_mouse` to provide the build configuration that is compatible with the `nRF Connect for Desktop`_ testing tool.

Bluetooth Fast Pair samples
---------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Bluetooth Mesh samples
----------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Cellular samples
----------------

  * :ref:`nrf_cloud_rest_cell_location`
  * :ref:`nrf_cloud_rest_device_message`
  * :ref:`nrf_cloud_rest_fota`

* :ref:`location_sample` sample:

|no_changes_yet_note|

DECT NR+ samples
----------------

* :ref:`dect_shell_application` sample:

  * Added:

    * The ``dect mac`` command.
      A brief MAC-level sample on top of DECT PHY interface with new commands to create a periodic cluster beacon, scan for it, associate or disassociate a PT/client, and send data to a FT/beacon random access window.
      This is not a full MAC implementation and not fully compliant with DECT NR+ MAC specification (`ETSI TS 103 636-4`_).
    * The ``startup_cmd`` command.
      This command is used to store shell commands to be run sequentially after bootup.

  * Updated:

    * The ``dect rssi_scan`` command with busy/possible/free subslot count-based RSSI scan.
    * The ``dect rx`` command to provide the possibility to iterate all channels and to enable RX filter.

Edge Impulse samples
--------------------

* :ref:`ei_data_forwarder_sample` sample:

  * Added support for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board.

* :ref:`ei_wrapper_sample` sample:

  * Added support for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board.

* :ref:`matter_template_sample` sample:

  * Updated the internal configuration for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54l15dk_nrf54l15` target to use the DFU image compression and provide more memory space for the application.

For the list of upstream Zephyr commits (not including cherry-picked commits) incorporated into nRF Connect SDK since the most recent release, run the following command from the :file:`ncs/zephyr` repository (after running ``west update``):

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline beb733919d ^ea02b93eea

For the list of |NCS| specific commits, including commits cherry-picked from upstream, run:

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline manifest-rev ^beb733919d

The current |NCS| main branch is based on revision ``beb733919d`` of Zephyr.
