Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

Machine learning
----------------

* Updated the application to enable the :ref:`Zephyr Memory Storage (ZMS) <zephyr:zms_api>` file system for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board.

Asset Tracker v2
----------------

* Updated the application to use the :ref:`lib_downloader` library instead of the deprecated :ref:`lib_download_client` library.

Connectivity Bridge
-------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

IPC radio firmware
------------------

* Updated the application to enable the :ref:`Zephyr Memory Storage (ZMS) <zephyr:zms_api>` file system in all devices that contain MRAM, such as the nRF54H Series devices.
* Updated documentation of applications and samples that use the IPC radio firmware as :ref:`companion component <companion_components>` to mention its usage when built with :ref:`configuration_system_overview_sysbuild`.

Matter Bridge
-------------

* Removed support for the nRF54H20 devices.
* Enabled Link Time Optimization (LTO) by default for the ``release`` configuration.

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Updated:

  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_failsafe` to use the Zephyr :ref:`zephyr:hwinfo_api` driver for getting and clearing the reset reason information (see the :c:func:`hwinfo_get_reset_cause` and :c:func:`hwinfo_clear_reset_cause` functions).
    The Zephyr :ref:`zephyr:hwinfo_api` driver replaces the dependency on the nrfx reset reason helper (see the :c:func:`nrfx_reset_reason_get` and :c:func:`nrfx_reset_reason_clear` functions).
  * The release configuration for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board target to enable the :ref:`nrf_desktop_failsafe` (see the :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_FAILSAFE_ENABLE <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option).
  * Enabled Link Time Optimization (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTO` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ISR_TABLES_LOCAL_DECLARATION`) by default for an nRF Desktop application image.
    LTO was also explicitly enabled in configurations of other images built by sysbuild (bootloader, network core image).
  * Application configurations for nRF54L05, nRF54L10, and nRF54L15 SoCs to use Fast Pair PSA cryptography (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_CRYPTO_PSA`).
    Using PSA cryptography improves security and reduces memory footprint.
    Also increased the size of the Bluetooth receiving thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_RX_STACK_SIZE`) to prevent stack overflows.
  * Application configurations for nRF52810 and nRF52820 SoCs to reduce memory footprint:

    * Disabled Bluetooth long workqueue (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_LONG_WQ`).
    * Limited the number of key slots in the PSA Crypto core to 10 (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_KEY_SLOT_COUNT`).

  * Application configurations for HID peripherals by increasing the following thread stack sizes to prevent stack overflows during the :c:func:`settings_load` operation:

    * The system workqueue thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SYSTEM_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE`).
    * The CAF settings loader thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_SETTINGS_LOADER_THREAD_STACK_SIZE`).

    This change results from the Bluetooth subsystem transition to the PSA cryptographic API.
    The GATT database hash calculation now requires larger stack size.

  * Support for Bluetooth LE legacy pairing is no longer enabled by default, because it is not secure.
    Using Bluetooth LE legacy pairing introduces, among others, a risk of passive eavesdropping.
    Supporting Bluetooth LE legacy pairing makes devices vulnerable for a downgrade attack.
    The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SMP_SC_PAIR_ONLY` Kconfig option is enabled by default in Zephyr.
    If you still need to support the Bluetooth LE legacy pairing, you need to disable the option in the configuration.
  * :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_state` and :ref:`nrf_desktop_fn_keys` to use :c:func:`bsearch` implementation from C library.
    This simplifies maintenance and allows you to use Picolibc (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PICOLIBC`).
  * The IPC radio image configurations of the nRF5340 DK to use Picolibc (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PICOLIBC`).
    This aligns the configurations to the IPC radio image configurations of the nRF54H20 DK.
    Picolibc is used by default in Zephyr.
  * The nRF Desktop application image configurations to use Picolibc (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PICOLIBC`) by default.
    Using the minimal libc implementation (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MINIMAL_LIBC`) no longer decreases the memory footprint of the application image for most of the configurations.

* Added:

  * System Power Management for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board target on the application and radio cores.
    The application still has high power consumption as the Bluetooth LE controller running on the radio core requires disabling MRAM latency (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MRAM_LATENCY_AUTO_REQ`).
    Enabling MRAM latency makes the Bluetooth LE controller unstable.
  * Application configurations for the nRF54L05 and nRF54L10 SoCs (emulated on the nRF54L15 DK).
    The configurations are supported through ``nrf54l15dk/nrf54l10/cpuapp`` and ``nrf54l15dk/nrf54l05/cpuapp`` board targets.
    For details, see the :ref:`nrf_desktop_board_configuration`.
  * The ``dongle_small`` configuration for the nRF52833 DK.
    The configuration enables logs and mimics the dongle configuration used for small SoCs.

* Removed an imply from the nRF Desktop Bluetooth connectivity Kconfig option (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BT <config_desktop_app_options>`).
  The imply enabled a separate workqueue for connection TX notify processing (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CONN_TX_NOTIFY_WQ`) if MPSL was used for synchronization between the flash memory driver and radio (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_RADIO_SYNC_MPSL`).
  The MPSL flash synchronization issue (``NCSDK-29354`` in the :ref:`known_issues`) is fixed.
  The workaround is no longer needed.

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Serial LTE modem
----------------

* Added an overlay :file:`overlay-memfault.conf` file to enable Memfault.
  For more information about Memfault features in |NCS|, see :ref:`mod_memfault`.
* Updated the application to use the :ref:`lib_downloader` library instead of the deprecated :ref:`lib_download_client` library.

Thingy:53: Matter weather station
---------------------------------

* Enabled Link Time Optimization (LTO) by default for the ``release`` configuration.

* Updated:

  * The non-secure target (``nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns`` and ``thingy53/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns``) configurations of all Fast Pair samples to use configurable TF-M profile instead of the predefined minimal TF-M profile:
    This change results from the Bluetooth subsystem transition to the PSA cryptographic standard.
    The Bluetooth stack can now use the PSA crypto API in the non-secure domain as all necessary TF-M partitions are configured properly.
  * The configuration of all Fast Pair samples by increasing the following thread stack sizes to prevent stack overflows:

    * The system workqueue thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SYSTEM_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE`).
    * The Bluetooth receiving thread stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_RX_STACK_SIZE`).

    This change results from the Bluetooth subsystem transition to the PSA cryptographic API.

* Removed using a separate workqueue for connection TX notify processing (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CONN_TX_NOTIFY_WQ`) from configurations.
  The MPSL flash synchronization issue (``NCSDK-29354`` in the :ref:`known_issues`) is fixed.
  The workaround is no longer needed.

* :ref:`fast_pair_locator_tag` sample:

  * Added:

    * Support for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board target.
    * Support for the firmware update intents on the Android platform.

Libraries
=========

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`library <libraries>`.

Binary libraries
----------------

* :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library:

  * Updated the glue to use the :ref:`lib_downloader` library instead of the deprecated :ref:`lib_download_client` library.

Bluetooth libraries and services
--------------------------------

* :ref:`bt_fast_pair_readme` library:

  * Added:

    * A restriction on the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_FMDN_TX_POWER` Kconfig option in the Find My Device Network (FMDN) extension configuration.
      You must set this Kconfig option now to ``0`` at minimum as the Fast Pair specification requires that the conducted Bluetooth transmit power for FMDN advertisements must not be lower than 0 dBm.
    * A new information callback - :c:member:`bt_fast_pair_fmdn_info_cb.conn_authenticated` - to the FMDN extension API.
      In the FMDN context, this change is required to support firmware update intents on the Android platform.
      For further details on the Android intent feature for firmware updates, see the :ref:`ug_bt_fast_pair_provisioning_register_firmware_update_intent` section in the Fast Pair integration guide.

  * Updated the automatically generated ``bt_fast_pair`` partition definition (located in the :file:`subsys/partition_manager/pm.yml.bt_fast_pair`) to work correctly when building with TF-M.

* :ref:`bt_mesh` library:

  * Fixed an issue in the :ref:`bt_mesh_light_ctrl_srv_readme` model to automatically resume the Lightness Controller after recalling a scene (``NCSDK-30033`` known issue).


* :ref:`bt_fast_pair_readme` library:

  * Updated the :c:func:`bt_fast_pair_info_cb_register` API to allow registration of multiple callbacks.
