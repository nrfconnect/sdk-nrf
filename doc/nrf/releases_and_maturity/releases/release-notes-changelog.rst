   "Protocols" section serves as a highlight section for all protocol-related changes, including those made to samples, libraries, and so on.

Known issues
************

Known issues are only tracked for the latest official release.
See `known issues for nRF Connect SDK v2.8.0`_ for the list of issues valid for the latest release.

Changelog
*********

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

IDE, OS, and tool support
=========================

|no_changes_yet_note|

Board support
=============

* Updated various tests and samples to use Zephyr's :ref:`native_sim<zephyr:native_sim>` instead of Zephyr's :ref:`native_posix<zephyr:native_posix>` for :ref:`running_unit_tests`.
  This mirrors the deprecation of ``native_posix`` in Zephyr.
  Support for ``native_posix`` will be removed in Zephyr with the v4.2 release.
  In the |NCS|, it will be removed once Zephyr v4.2 is upmerged to sdk-nrf.

Build and configuration system
==============================

|no_changes_yet_note|

Bootloaders and DFU
===================

* Updated the allowed offset for :ref:`doc_fw_info` in the :ref:`bootloader`.
  It can now be placed at offset ``0x600``, however, it cannot be used for any applications with |NSIB| compiled before this change.

Developing with nRF91 Series
============================

Developing with nRF70 Series
============================

|no_changes_yet_note|

Working with nRF54H Series
==========================

Developing with nRF53 Series
============================

|no_changes_yet_note|

Developing with nRF52 Series
============================

|no_changes_yet_note|

Developing with Front-End Modules
=================================

* Deprecated the explicit use of ``-DSHIELD=nrf21540ek_fwd`` for boards with ``nrf5340/cpuapp`` qualifiers when the nRF21540 EK shield is used.
  The build system uses an appropriate overlay file for each core, relying only on the ``-DSHIELD=nrf21540ek`` parameter.

Developing with PMICs

* Added:

  * Implementation of the :cpp:class:`Spake2pVerifier` class for the PSA crypto backend.
    You can use this class to generate the Spake2+ verifier at runtime.
    To use this class, enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_WANT_ALG_PBKDF2_HMAC` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_KEY_PAIR_DERIVE` Kconfig options.

Matter fork
+++++++++++

The Matter fork in the |NCS| (``sdk-connectedhomeip``) contains all commits from the upstream Matter repository up to, and including, the ``v1.4.0.0`` tag.

The following list summarizes the most important changes inherited from the upstream Matter:

* Added:

  * Enhanced Network Infrastructure with Home Routers and Access Points (HRAP).
    This provides requirements for devices such as home routers, modems or access points to create a necessary infrastructure for Matter products.
  * Enhanced Multi-Admin that aims to simplify the smart home management from the user perspective.
    This term includes several different features and in this release only Fabric Synchronization was fully delivered.
    The Fabric Synchronization enables commissioning of devices from one fabric to another without requiring manual user actions, only user consent.
  * Dynamic SIT LIT switching support that allows the application to switch between these modes, as long as the requirements for these modes are met.
    This can be enabled using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ICD_DSLS_SUPPORT` Kconfig option.
  * The Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ICD_SIT_SLOW_POLL_LIMIT` to limit the slow polling interval value for the device while it is in the SIT mode.
    This can be used to limit the slow poll interval for the ICD LIT device while it is temporarily working in the SIT mode.
  * New device types:

    * Water heater
    * Solar power
    * Battery storage
    * Heat pump
    * Mounted on/off control
    * Mounted dimmable load control

* Updated:

  * Thermostat cluster with support for scheduling and preset modes, like vacation, and home or away settings.
  * Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) with support for user-defined charging preferences, like specifying the time when the car will be charged.
  * Occupancy sensing cluster with features like radar, vision, and ambient sensing.
  * Intermittently Connected Devices feature with enhancements for the Long Idle Time (LIT) and Check-In Protocol.
    With this enhancements, the state of this feature is changed from provisional to certifiable.

nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver
------------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Thread
------

* Added Kconfig options for configuring the MLE child update timeout, child supervision interval, and child supervision check timeout.

------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Wi-Fi
-----

* Updated the :ref:`wifi_regulatory_channel_rules` for some countries in the :ref:`ug_nrf70_developing_regulatory_support` documentation.

Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

Machine learning
----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Asset Tracker v2
----------------

* Updated the Wi-Fi configurations to reduce the RAM usage by about 25 kB for the nRF91 Series DK and 12 kB for the Thingy:91 X.

Connectivity Bridge
-------------------

* Updated the handling of USB CDC ACM baud rate requests to make sure the baud rate is set correctly when the host requests a change.
  This fixes an issue when using GNU screen with the Thingy:91 X.

IPC radio firmware
------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Matter Bridge
-------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

* Updated the documentation for :ref:`nrf53_audio_app_building` with cross-links and additional information, based on user feedback.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Updated:

  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_settings_loader` to make the :ref:`Zephyr Memory Storage (ZMS) <zephyr:zms_api>` the default settings backend for all board targets that use the MRAM technology.
    As a result, all :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` configurations were migrated from the NVS settings backend to the ZMS settings backend.
  * The :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` release configuration to enable the :ref:`nrf_desktop_watchdog`.
  * The configuration files of the :ref:`nrf_desktop_click_detector` (:file:`click_detector_def.h`) to allow using them also when Bluetooth LE peer control using a dedicated button (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_PEER_CONTROL <config_desktop_app_options>`) is disabled.
  * The DTS description for board targets with a different DTS overlay file for each build type to isolate the common configuration that is now defined in the :file:`app_common.dtsi` file.
    The following board configurations have been updated:

    * :ref:`zephyr:nrf52840dk_nrf52840`
    * :ref:`zephyr:nrf52840dongle_nrf52840`
    * :ref:`zephyr:nrf54l15dk_nrf54l15`
    * :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20`

  * MCUboot bootloader configurations to enable the following Kconfig options:

    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FPROTECT` - Used to protect the bootloader partition against memory corruption.
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_HW_STACK_PROTECTION` - Used to protect against stack overflows.

    The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_HW_STACK_PROTECTION` Kconfig option and its dependency (the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ARM_MPU` Kconfig option) might be disabled in case of targets with limited memory.

  * MCUboot bootloader configuration for the MCUboot SMP build type and the nRF52840 Gaming Mouse target to enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ARM_MPU` Kconfig option that is required to enable hardware stack protection (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_HW_STACK_PROTECTION`).

* Removed imply for partial erase feature of the nRF SoC flash driver (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_PARTIAL_ERASE`) for the USB next stack (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_USB_STACK_NEXT <config_desktop_app_options>`).
  The partial erase feature was used as a workaround for device errors that might be reported by the Windows USB host in Device Manager if a USB cable is connected while erasing a secondary image slot in the background.
  The workaround is no longer needed after the nRF UDC driver was improved.
