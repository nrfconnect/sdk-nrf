Zephyr
======

.. NOTE TO MAINTAINERS: All the Zephyr commits in the below git commands must be handled specially after each upmerge and each nRF Connect SDK release.

The Zephyr fork in |NCS| (``sdk-zephyr``) contains all commits from the upstream Zephyr repository up to and including ``a768a05e6205e415564226543cee67559d15b736``, with some |NCS| specific additions.

For the list of upstream Zephyr commits (not including cherry-picked commits) incorporated into nRF Connect SDK since the most recent release, run the following command from the :file:`ncs/zephyr` repository (after running ``west update``):

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline a768a05e62 ^4bbd91a908

For the list of |NCS| specific commits, including commits cherry-picked from upstream, run:

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline manifest-rev ^a768a05e62

The current |NCS| main branch is based on revision ``a768a05e62`` of Zephyr.

.. note::
   For possible breaking changes and changes between the latest Zephyr release and the current Zephyr version, refer to the :ref:`Zephyr release notes <zephyr_release_notes>`.

Trusted Firmware-M
==================

* The minimal TF-M build profile no longer silences TF-M logs by default.

  .. note::
     This can be a breaking change if the UART instance used by TF-M is already in use, for example by modem trace with a UART backend.
