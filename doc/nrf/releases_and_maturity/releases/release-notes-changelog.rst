Changelog
*********

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

IDE and tool support
====================

|no_changes_yet_note|

Application development
=======================

This section provides detailed lists of changes to overarching SDK systems and components.

Build system
------------

* Removed the ``CONFIG_MCUBOOT_IMAGE_VERSION`` Kconfig option in favor of using a dedicated :ref:`application VERSION file <zephyr:app-version-details>` to set the version.
  You can alternatively set the version by using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_IMGTOOL_SIGN_VERSION` Kconfig option, but using a :file:`VERSION` file is the recommended approach.

* The |NCS| name and version is now displayed instead of the Zephyr version as the default boot banner when applications boot.
  This can be customized in user applications.

nRF Front-End Modules
---------------------

* Updated the name of the ``nrf21540_ek`` shield to ``nrf21540ek``.

Working with nRF91 Series
=========================

* Added support for :ref:`nrf91_modem_trace_uart_snippet`.
  Snippet is used for nRF91 modem tracing with the UART backend for the following applications and samples:

  * :ref:`asset_tracker_v2`
  * :ref:`serial_lte_modem`
  * All samples that use nRF91 Series DK except for :ref:`slm_shell_sample`, :ref:`modem_trace_flash`, :ref:`modem_trace_backend_sample`.

  For samples where the UART trace backend is enabled by default, the configuration is added to the sample overlays and project configuration.

* The default board revision for nRF9160 DK has changed to v0.14.0.
  See :ref:`nrf9160_board_revisions` for more details.

Working with nRF52 Series
=========================

Protocols
=========

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`protocol <protocols>`.
See `Samples`_ for lists of changes for the protocol-related samples.

BluetoothÂ® LE
-------------

* Updated the Bluetooth HCI headers.
  The :file:`hci.h` header now contains only the function prototypes, and the new
  :file:`hci_types.h` header defines all HCI-related macros and structs.

  The previous :file:`hci_err.h` header has been merged into the new :file:`hci_types.h` header.
  This can break builds that were directly including :file:`hci_err.h`.

Bluetooth mesh
--------------

* Added support for Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) PSA as the crypto backend for mesh security toolbox for the platforms with :ref:`CMSE enabled <app_boards_spe_nspe_cpuapp_ns>`.

See `Bluetooth mesh samples`_ for the list of changes in the Bluetooth mesh samples.

Matter
------

* Added:

  * Page about :ref:`ug_matter_device_optimizing_memory`.
  * Shell commands for printing and resetting the peak usage of critical system resources used by Matter.
    These shell commands are available when both :kconfig:option:`CHIP_LIB_SHELL` and :kconfig:option:`CHIP_STATISTICS` Kconfig options are set.
  * Reaction to removing the last fabric.
    The user now decides what happens after the removal:

    * Do nothing (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_LAST_FABRIC_REMOVED_NONE`).
    * Perform a factory reset of the device (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_LAST_FABRIC_REMOVED_ERASE_ONLY`).
    * Perform a factory reset of the device and start Bluetooth LE advertising (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_LAST_FABRIC_REMOVED_ERASE_AND_PAIRING_START`).
    * Perform a factory reset of the device and then reboot the device (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_LAST_FABRIC_REMOVED_ERASE_AND_REBOOT`).

* Updated:

  * Matter over Thread samples so that the OpenThread shell is disabled by default.
  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_FACTORY_RESET_ERASE_NVS` Kconfig option to be enabled by default, including for builds without factory data support.
    The firmware now erases all flash pages in the non-volatile storage during a factory reset, instead of just clearing Matter-related settings.
  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_EXTENDED_DISCOVERY` Kconfig option to be disabled by default.
    The commissionable node now does not advertise a commissioning service when it does not have the commissioning window open.
  * The RAM usage based on test measurements.
    After the following optimizations, the RAM usage decreased by around 12-20% on all supported boards:

    * Reduced the number of network and Matter stack buffers and packets.
    * Disabled SSL server support.
    * Reduced the Main, Matter and OpenThread stack sizes.
    * Reduced the Mbed TLS heap size.
    * Improved the buffer usage of the nRF700X driver for Matter.
    * Reduced the size of the Matter event queue.

* Fixed:

  * An IPC crash on nRF5340 when Zephyr's main thread takes a long time.
  * An application core crash on nRF5340 targets with the factory data module enabled.
    The crash would happen after the OTA firmware update finishes and the image is confirmed.

See `Matter samples`_ for the list of changes for the Matter samples.

Matter fork
+++++++++++

The Matter fork in the |NCS| (``sdk-connectedhomeip``) contains all commits from the upstream Matter repository up to, and including, the ``v1.1.0.1`` tag.

The following list summarizes the most important changes inherited from the upstream Matter:

* Added the :kconfig:option:`CHIP_MALLOC_SYS_HEAP_WATERMARKS_SUPPORT` Kconfig option to manage watermark support.

* Updated:

  * The factory data guide with an additional rotating ID information.
  * Set onboarding code generation to be enabled by default if the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_FACTORY_DATA_BUILD` Kconfig is set.

* Fixed RAM and ROM reports.

|no_changes_yet_note|

Wi-Fi
-----

* Added:

  * Integration of Wi-Fi connectivity with Connection Manager connectivity API.
  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_WIFI_IF_AUTO_START` Kconfig option to enable an application to set/unset AUTO_START on an interface.
    This can be done by using the ``NET_IF_NO_AUTO_START`` flag.
  * Support for sending TWT sleep/wake events to applications.
  * The nRF5340 HFCLK192M clock divider is set to the default value ``Div4`` for lower power consumption when the QSPI peripheral is idle.
  * Extensions to the scan command to provide better control over some scan parameters.

Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

Asset Tracker v2
----------------

* Added support for the nRF9161 development kit.

* Updated:

  * Default value of the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DATA_ACTIVE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` is changed to 300 seconds.
  * Enabled link time optimization to reduce the flash size of the application.
    You can disable this using the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ASSET_TRACKER_V2_LTO`.
  * Replaced overlay arguments ``OVERLAY_CONFIG`` and ``DTC_OVERLAY_FILE`` with the new Zephyr overlay arguments ``EXTRA_CONF_FILE`` and ``EXTRA_DTC_OVERLAY_FILE`` so as to avoid overriding of board overlay for the nRF9160 DK v0.14.0.
  * Possibility for the cloud integration to request the location back to the device for Wi-Fi or cellular positioning.
  * Fixed an issue with movement timeout handling in passive mode.

Serial LTE modem
----------------

* Added:

  * Support for the nRF9161 development kit.
  * ``#XMODEMRESET`` AT command to reset the modem while keeping the application running.
    It is expected to be used during modem firmware update, which now only requires a reset of the modem.
  * DTLS connection identifier support to the ``#XSSOCKETOPT`` and ``#XUDPCLI`` AT commands.
  * Full modem FOTA support to the ``#XFOTA`` AT command.
  * An ``auto_connect`` operation in the ``#XCARRIER`` carrier command.
    The operation controls automatic registration of UE to LTE network.
  * ``#XNRFCLOUDPOS`` AT command to send location requests to nRF Cloud using cellular or Wi-Fi positioning, or both.
  * Support for using A-GPS and P-GPS at the same time.

* Updated:

  * The configuration to enable support for nRF Cloud A-GPS service and nRF Cloud Location service by default.
  * UART receive refactored to utilize hardware flow control (HWFC) instead of disabling and enabling UART receiving between commands.
  * UART transmit has been refactored to utilize buffering.
    Multiple responses can now be received in a single transmission.
  * Modem FOTA to only need a modem reset to apply the firmware update.
    The full chip reset (using the ``#XRESET`` AT command) remains supported.
  * ``#XGPSDEL`` AT command to disallow deleting local clock (TCXO) frequency offset data because it is an internal value that should not be deleted when simulating a cold start.

* Removed:

  * DFU AT commands ``#XDFUGET``, ``#XDFUSIZE`` and ``#XDFURUN`` because they were not usable without a custom application in the target (nRF52 series) device.
  * Support for bootloader FOTA update because it is not needed for Serial LTE modem.
  * Option to set or get HWFC setting from ``#XSLMUART`` AT command.
  * Operations to read or erase the MCUboot secondary slot from the ``#XFOTA`` AT command because the application update process overwrites the slot in any case.
  * AT commands ``#XCELLPOS`` and ``#XWIFIPOS``.
    They are replaced by the ``#XNRFCLOUDPOS`` command that allows to combine cellular and Wi-Fi data to determine the device location.
  * The AT commands ``#XAGPS`` and ``#XPGPS``.
    Their functionality is merged into the ``#XGPS`` AT command that now allows using A-GPS and P-GPS at the same time.

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

* Updated the :ref:`application documentation <nrf53_audio_app>` by splitting it into several pages.
* Added back the QDID number to the documentation.

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

* Updated the machine learning models (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_EDGE_IMPULSE_URI`) used by the application so that they are now hosted by Nordic Semiconductor.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Added:

  * Kconfig options to enable handling of the power management events for the following nRF Desktop modules:

    * :ref:`nrf_desktop_board` - The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BOARD_PM_EVENTS <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option.
    * :ref:`nrf_desktop_motion` - The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_PM_EVENTS <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option.
    * :ref:`nrf_desktop_ble_latency` - The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_LATENCY_PM_EVENTS <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option.

    All listed Kconfig options are enabled by default and depend on the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_PM_EVENTS` Kconfig option.
  * Kconfig option to configure a motion generated per second during a button press (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_BUTTONS_MOTION_PER_SEC <config_desktop_app_options>`) in the :ref:`nrf_desktop_motion`.
    The implementation relies on the hardware clock instead of system uptime to improve accuracy of the motion data generated when pressing a button.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_measuring_hid_report_rate` section in the nRF Desktop documentation.

* Updated:

  * Set the max compiled-in log level to ``warning`` for the USB HID class (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USB_HID_LOG_LEVEL_CHOICE`) and reduce the log message levels used in the :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state_pm` source code.
    This is done to avoid flooding logs during USB state changes.
  * If the USB state is set to :c:enum:`USB_STATE_POWERED`, the :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state_pm` restricts the power down level to the :c:enum:`POWER_MANAGER_LEVEL_SUSPENDED` instead of requiring :c:enum:`POWER_MANAGER_LEVEL_ALIVE`.
    This is done to prevent the device from powering down and waking up multiple times when an USB cable is connected.
  * Disabled ``CONFIG_BOOT_SERIAL_IMG_GRP_HASH`` in MCUboot bootloader release configurations of boards that use nRF52820 SoC.
    This is done to reduce the memory consumption.
  * To improve the accuracy, the generation of simulated movement data in the :ref:`nrf_desktop_motion` now uses a timestamp in microseconds based on the cycle count (either :c:func:`k_cycle_get_32` or :c:func:`k_cycle_get_64` function depending on the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TIMER_HAS_64BIT_CYCLE_COUNTER` Kconfig option).
  * Aligned Kconfig option names in the :ref:`nrf_desktop_motion` implementation that generates motion from button presses.
    The Kconfig options defining used key IDs are prefixed with ``CONFIG_MOTION_BUTTONS_`` instead of ``CONFIG_MOTION_`` to ensure consistency with configuration of other implementations of the motion module.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_ble_scan` no longer stops Bluetooth LE scanning when it receives :c:struct:`hid_report_event` related to a HID output report.
    Sending HID output report is triggered by a HID host.
    Scanning stop may lead to an edge case where the scanning is stopped, but there are no peripherals connected to the dongle.

Thingy:53: Matter weather station
---------------------------------

* Added support for the nRF7002 Wi-Fi expansion board.

Matter Bridge
-------------

* Added:

  * The :ref:`Matter bridge <matter_bridge_app>` application.
  * Support for the Bluetooth LE bridged devices.
  * Support for bridging of the Bluetooth LE Environmental Sensor (ESP).
  * Support for performing Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) over Bluetooth LE using Simple Management Protocol (SMP).

Bluetooth libraries and services
--------------------------------

* :ref:`bt_fast_pair_readme` library:

  * Updated by deleting reset in progress flag from settings storage instead of storing it as ``false`` on factory reset operation.
    This is done to ensure that no Fast Pair data is left in the settings storage after the factory reset.
  * Changed the :c:struct:`bt_fast_pair_adv_config` structure and the :c:enum:`bt_fast_pair_adv_mode` enumerator to separate advertising mode from show or hide UI indication advertising information.
  * Renamed following Kconfig options:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_EXT_PN` Kconfig option to the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_PN` Kconfig option.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_STORAGE_EXT_PN` Kconfig option to the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_STORAGE_PN` Kconfig option.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_STORAGE_EXT_PN_LEN_MAX` Kconfig option to the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_STORAGE_PN_LEN_MAX` Kconfig option.

  * Updated the Fast Pair storage module to overwrite the least recently used Account Key instead of the oldest Account Key on Account Key write.

* :ref:`bt_le_adv_prov_readme` library:

  * Changed the allowed range of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_FAST_PAIR_ADV_BUF_SIZE` Kconfig option and set its default value to 26.
    This is done to align the buffer size to the new Fast Pair not discoverable advertising data size after the size of the salt included in the data was increased from 1 byte to 2 bytes.
    The default value has been set to maximum to mitigate buffer overflow issues in the future.

* :ref:`bt_mesh` library:

  * Added:

    * The :kconfig:option:`BT_MESH_LIGHT_CTRL_AMB_LIGHT_LEVEL_TIMEOUT` Kconfig option that configures a timeout before resetting the ambient light level to zero.
    * The :c:member:`bt_mesh_light_hue.direction` field that specifies direction of the Hue state transition.

  * Updated:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_MODEL_SRV_STORE_TIMEOUT` Kconfig option, that is controlling timeout for storing of model states, is replaced by the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_STORE_TIMEOUT` Kconfig option.
    * The Light Lightness Actual and Generic Power Level states of the :ref:`bt_mesh_lightness_srv_readme` and :ref:`bt_mesh_plvl_srv_readme` models cannot dim to off.
      This is due to binding with Generic Level state when receiving Generic Delta Set and Generic Move Set messages.
    * The :c:member:`bt_mesh_light_hue_srv_handlers.move_set` callback of the :ref:`bt_mesh_light_hue_srv_readme` model is only called for a continuous transition.
      All other transitions are now handled by the :c:member:`bt_mesh_light_hue_srv_handlers.set` callback.
    * The Hue Range state of the :ref:`bt_mesh_light_hue_srv_readme` model now allows :c:member:`bt_mesh_light_hsl_range.max` to be lower than :c:member:`bt_mesh_light_hsl_range.min`.

  * Fixed:

    * An issue where the :ref:`bt_mesh_dtt_srv_readme` model could not be found for models spanning multiple elements.
    * An issue where the :ref:`bt_mesh_sensor_srv_readme` model would add a corrupted marshalled sensor data into the Sensor Status message, because the fetched sensor value was outside the range.
      If the fetched sensor value is out of range, the marshalled sensor data for that sensor is not added to the Sensor Status message.

  * Removed:

    * The ``bt_mesh_light_hue_srv_handlers.delta_set`` callback of the :ref:`bt_mesh_light_hue_srv_readme` model is removed and replaced with the :c:member:`bt_mesh_light_hue_srv_handlers.set` callback.

    * The :c:macro:`NRF_MODEM_LIB_ON_DFU_RES` macro to add callbacks for modem DFU results.

  * Replaced the use of :c:macro:`SO_BINDTODEVICE` socket option with :c:macro:`SO_BINDTOPDN` to bind the socket to a PDN.
    The new option takes an integer for the PDN ID instead of a string.

  * Updated:

    * The :c:func:`nrf_modem_lib_shutdown` function to allow the modem to be in flight mode (``CFUN=4``) when shutting down the modem.
    * The trace backends can now return ``-EAGAIN`` if the write operation can be retried.
    * The trace backends can now be suspended when tracing is inactive and resumed when active.
      This is added to the UART trace backend.
    * Fixed a rare bug that caused a deadlock between two threads when one thread sent data while the other received a lot of data quickly.
    * The ``SO_IP_ECHO_REPLY``, ``SO_IPV6_ECHO_REPLY``, ``SO_TCP_SRV_SESSTIMEO`` and ``SO_SILENCE_ALL`` socket option levels to align with the modem option levels.
    * The :ref:`modem_trace_module` is now initialized before the callbacks registered using the :c:macro:`NRF_MODEM_LIB_ON_INIT` macro are called.
    * The minimal value of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_SHMEM_RX_SIZE` Kconfig option to meet the requirements of modem firmware v2.0.0.

      The application uses the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_RAI_REQ` and ``SO_RAI_*`` socket options instead.
    * The CE level enum names for :c:enum:`lte_lc_ce_level` to not include the number of repetitions.
    * The default network mode from :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_NETWORK_MODE_LTE_M` to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_NETWORK_MODE_LTE_M_GPS`.

    * The semantics of cellular and Wi-Fi timeouts to only apply to neighbor cell measurement and Wi-Fi scan, respectively.
      Earlier, these timeouts applied also to the upcoming cloud connection to send the data to the cloud for position resolution.
      Overall :c:func:`location_request()` timeout can still interrupt cloud data transfer.

* :ref:`pdn_readme` library:

  * Updated the library to allow a ``PDP_type``-only configuration in the :c:func:`pdn_ctx_configure` function.

* :ref:`modem_key_mgmt` library:

  * Updated the :c:func:`modem_key_mgmt_cmp` function to return ``1`` if the buffer length does not match the certificate length.

* :ref:`sms_readme` library:

  * Added support for providing input text as a GSM 7bit encoded hexadecimal string to send some special characters that cannot be sent using ASCII string.

    * Support for CoAP CBOR type handling to :c:struct:`nrf_cloud_obj`.
    * Warning message discouraging use of :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_PROVISION_CERTIFICATES` for purposes other than testing.
    * Reporting of protocol (MQTT, REST, or CoAP) as well as method (LTE or Wi-Fi) to the device shadow.
    * Kconfig choice :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_WIFI_LOCATION_ENCODE_OPT` for selecting the data that is encoded in Wi-Fi location requests.
    * Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_FOTA_AUTO_START_JOB` for controlling whether a FOTA update job is started automatically or at the request of the application.
    * An event :c:enum:`NRF_CLOUD_EVT_FOTA_JOB_AVAILABLE` that indicates a FOTA update job is available.
    * :c:func:`nrf_cloud_fota_job_start` function that starts a FOTA update job.

  * Updated:

    * JSON manipulation moved from :file:`nrf_cloud_fota.c` to :file:`nrf_cloud_codec_internal.c`.
    * :c:func:`nrf_cloud_obj_location_request_create` to use the new function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_obj_location_request_payload_add`.

    * A bug preventing ``AIR_QUAL`` from being enabled in shadow UI service info.
    * A bug that prevented an MQTT FOTA job from being started.

  * Removed:

    * Unused internal codec function ``nrf_cloud_format_single_cell_pos_req_json()``.
    * ``nrf_cloud_location_request_msg_json_encode()`` function and replaced with :c:func:`nrf_cloud_obj_location_request_create`.
    * ``nrf_cloud_location_req_json_encode()`` internal codec function.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_rest` library:

  * Updated the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_rest_location_get` function to use the new function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_obj_location_request_payload_add`.

    * FOTA download Utils API integrated to the library.

  * Updated Zephyr's LwM2M Connectivity Monitor object to use a 16-bit value for radio signal strength so that it does not roll over on values smaller than -126 dBm.

* :ref:`lib_aws_fota` library:

  * Added support for a single ``url`` field in job documents.
    Previously, the host name and path of the download URL could only be specified separately.

  * Updated:

Libraries for NFC
-----------------

* Fixed a potential issue where the NFC interrupt context switching could result in loss of interrupt data.
  This could happen if interrupts would be executed much faster than the NFC workqueue or thread.

* Fixed an issue where an assertion could be triggered when requesting clock from the NFC platform interrupt context.
  The NFC interrupt is no longer a zero latency interrupt.

* :ref:`nfc_t4t_isodep_readme` library:

  * Fixed the ISO-DEP error recovery process in case where the R(ACK) frame is received in response to the R(NAK) frame from the poller device.
    The poller device raised a false semantic error instead of resending the last I-block.

------------

The following changes are applied to :ref:`nrf_security` library:

* Updated the subsystem and its library to be renamed from Nordic Security Module to nRF Security.

* Removed:

  * Option to build Mbed TLS built-in PSA core (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_CORE_BUILTIN`).

Common Application Framework (CAF)
----------------------------------

* Added :ref:`caf_shell` for triggering CAF events.

* :ref:`caf_buttons`:

  * Added selective wakeup functionality.
    The module's configuration file can specify a subset of buttons that is not used to trigger an application wakeup.
    Each row and column specifies an additional flag (:c:member:`gpio_pin.wakeup_blocked`) that can be set to prevent an entire row or column of buttons from acting as a wakeup source.

* :ref:`caf_ble_adv`:

  * Updated:

    * The dependencies of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_BLE_ADV_FILTER_ACCEPT_LIST` Kconfig option so that it can be used when the Bluetooth controller is running on the network core.
    * The library by improving broadcast of :c:struct:`module_state_event`.
      The event informing about entering either :c:enum:`MODULE_STATE_READY` or :c:enum:`MODULE_STATE_OFF` is not submitted until the CAF Bluetooth LE advertising module is initialized and ready.

* :ref:`caf_ble_state`:

  * Removed TX power update using a Bluetooth HCI command for SoftDevice Bluetooth LE Link Layer (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_LL_SOFTDEVICE`) right after a connection has been established.
    The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_PWR` Kconfig option can be used to set the TX power for advertising and connections also for the SoftDevice Link Layer.

* :ref:`caf_power_manager`:

  * Reduced verbosity of logs denoting allowed power states from ``info`` to ``debug``.

Shell libraries

DFU libraries
-------------

* Added a new DFU SMP target for the image update to an external MCU by using the MCUmgr SMP Client.


Scripts
=======

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`script <scripts>`.

* :ref:`partition_manager`:

  * The size of the span partitions was changed to include the alignment partitions (``EMPTY_x``) appearing between other partitions, but not alignment partitions at the beginning or end of the span partition.
    The size of the span partitions now reflects the memory space taken from the start of the first of its elements to the end of the last, not just the sum of the sizes of the included partitions.

* :ref:`west_sbom`:

  * Changed:

    * To reduce RAM usage, the script now runs the `Scancode-Toolkit`_ detector in a single process.
      This change slows down the licenses detector, because it is no longer executed simultaneously on all files.
    * SPDX License List database updated to version 3.21.
