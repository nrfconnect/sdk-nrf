Wi-Fi
-----

* Added:

    This can be done by using the ``NET_IF_NO_AUTO_START`` flag.

Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

nRF9160: Asset Tracker v2
-------------------------

* Updated:

  * Default value of the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DATA_ACTIVE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` is changed to 300 seconds.
  * Enabled link time optimization to reduce the flash size of the application.
    You can disable this using the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ASSET_TRACKER_V2_LTO`.

* Fixed an issue with movement timeout handling in passive mode.

nRF9160: Serial LTE modem
-------------------------

* Removed:

  * DFU AT commands ``#XDFUGET``, ``#XDFUSIZE`` and ``#XDFURUN`` because they were not usable without a custom application in the target (nRF52 series) device.
  * Support for bootloader FOTA update because it is not needed for Serial LTE modem.

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

* Updated the machine learning models (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_EDGE_IMPULSE_URI`) used by the application so that they are now hosted by Nordic Semiconductor.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Added Kconfig options to enable handling of the power management events for the following nRF Desktop modules:

  * :ref:`nrf_desktop_board` - The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BOARD_PM_EVENTS <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option.
  * :ref:`nrf_desktop_motion` - The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_PM_EVENTS <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option.
  * :ref:`nrf_desktop_ble_latency` - The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_LATENCY_PM_EVENTS <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option.

  All listed Kconfig options are enabled by default and depend on the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_PM_EVENTS` Kconfig option.

* Updated:

  * Set the max compiled-in log level to ``warning`` for the USB HID class (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USB_HID_LOG_LEVEL_CHOICE`) and reduce the log message levels used in the :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state_pm` source code.
    This is done to avoid flooding logs during USB state changes.
  * If the USB state is set to :c:enum:`USB_STATE_POWERED`, the :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state_pm` restricts the power down level to the :c:enum:`POWER_MANAGER_LEVEL_SUSPENDED` instead of requiring :c:enum:`POWER_MANAGER_LEVEL_ALIVE`.
    This is done to prevent the device from powering down and waking up multiple times when an USB cable is connected.
  * Disabled ``CONFIG_BOOT_SERIAL_IMG_GRP_HASH`` in MCUboot bootloader release configurations of boards that use nRF52820 SoC.
    This is done to reduce the memory consumption.

Thingy:53: Matter weather station
---------------------------------

* Added support for the nRF7002 Wi-Fi expansion board.

* :ref:`nrf_cloud_rest_cell_pos_sample` sample:

  * Added:

    * The ``disable_response`` parameter to the :c:struct:`nrf_cloud_rest_location_request` structure.
      If set to true, no location data is returned to the device when the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_rest_location_get` function is called.
    * A Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`REST_CELL_LOCATION_SAMPLE_VERSION` for the sample version.

  * Updated the sample to print its version when started.

* :ref:`modem_shell_application` sample:

  * The sample now uses the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_obj_pgps_request_create` to create a P-GPS request.

Scripts
=======

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`script <scripts>`.

* :ref:`partition_manager`:

  * The size of the span partitions was changed to include the alignment paritions (``EMPTY_x``) appearing between other partitions, but not alignment partitions at the beginning or end of the span partition.
    The size of the span partitions now reflects the memory space taken from the start of the first of its elements to the end of the last, not just the sum of the sizes of the included partitions.

* :ref:`west_sbom`:

  * Changed:

    * To reduce RAM usage, the script now runs the `Scancode-Toolkit`_ detector in a single process.
      This change slows down the licenses detector, because it is no longer executed simultaneously on all files.

MCUboot
=======

The MCUboot fork in |NCS| (``sdk-mcuboot``) contains all commits from the upstream MCUboot repository up to and including ``74c4d1c52fd51d07904b27a7aa9b2303e896a4e3``, with some |NCS| specific additions.

The code for integrating MCUboot into |NCS| is located in the :file:`ncs/nrf/modules/mcuboot` folder.
