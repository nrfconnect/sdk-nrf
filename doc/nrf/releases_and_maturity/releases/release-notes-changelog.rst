See `Samples`_ for lists of changes for the protocol-related samples.

BluetoothÂ® LE
-------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Bluetooth Mesh
--------------

* Updated:

  * The Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_DFU_METADATA_ON_BUILD` to no longer depend on the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_DFU_METADATA`.
  * The Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_DFU_CLI` to no longer enable the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_DFU_METADATA_ON_BUILD` by default.
    The Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_DFU_METADATA_ON_BUILD` can still be manually enabled.
  * The JSON file, added to :file:`dfu_application.zip` during the automatic DFU metadata generation, to now contain a field for the ``core_type`` used when encoding the metadata.

Matter
------

* Added:

  * Support for merging the generated factory data HEX file with the firmware HEX file by using the devicetree configuration, when Partition Manager is not enabled in the project.
  * Support for the unified Persistent Storage API, including the implementation of the PSA Persistent Storage.

* Updated default MRP retry intervals for Thread devices to two seconds to reduce the number of spurious retransmissions in Thread networks.
* Increased the number of available packet buffers in the Matter stack to avoid packet allocation issues.

Matter fork
+++++++++++

The Matter fork in the |NCS| (``sdk-connectedhomeip``) contains all commits from the upstream Matter repository up to, and including, the ``v1.2.0.1`` tag.

The following list summarizes the most important changes inherited from the upstream Matter:

* Updated:

   * The scripts for factory data generation and related :doc:`matter:nrfconnect_factory_data_configuration` documentation page.
     Now, you can use a single script to generate both JSON and HEX files that include the factory data.
     Previously, you would have to do that in two steps using two separate scripts.
     The older method is still supported for backward compatibility.

|no_changes_yet_note|

Thread
------

* Initial experimental support for nRF54L15 for the Thread CLI and Co-processor samples.
* Added new :ref:`feature set <thread_ug_feature_sets>` option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_OPENTHREAD_NORDIC_LIBRARY_RCP`.

Zigbee
------

* Fixed an issue with Zigbee FOTA updates failing after a previous attempt was interrupted.

Gazell
------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB)
-------------------------

* Added support for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` and :ref:`nRF54L15 PDK <ug_nrf54l15_gs>` boards.
* Added fast switching between radio states for the nRF54H20 SoC.
* Added fast radio channel switching for the nRF54H20 SoC.

nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver
------------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Wi-Fi
-----

|no_changes_yet_note|

Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

Asset Tracker v2
----------------

* Updated:

  * The MQTT topic name for A-GNSS requests is changed to ``agnss`` for AWS and Azure backends.
  * GNSS heading is only sent to the cloud when it is considered accurate enough.

Serial LTE modem
----------------

* Removed:

  * Mention of Termite and Teraterm terminal emulators from the documentation.
    The recommended approach is to use one of the emulators listed on the :ref:`test_and_optimize` page.
  * Sending GNSS UI service info to nRF Cloud; this is no longer required by the cloud.

* Updated:

  * AT command parsing to utilize the :ref:`at_cmd_custom_readme` library.

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

* Updated:

  * Removed the LE Audio controller for nRF5340 library.
    The only supported controller for LE Audio is :ref:`ug_ble_controller_softdevice`.
    This enables use of standard tools for building, configuring, and DFU.

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

* Updated the ``ml_runner`` application module to allow running a machine learning model without anomaly support.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Added:

  * Support for the nRF54L15 PDK with the ``nrf54l15pdk_nrf54l15_cpuapp`` board target.
    The PDK can act as a sample mouse or keyboard.
    It supports the Bluetooth LE HID data transport and uses SoftDevice Link Layer with Low Latency Packet Mode (LLPM) enabled.
    The PDK uses MCUboot bootloader built in the direct-xip mode (``MCUBOOT+XIP``) and supports firmware updates using the :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu`.
  * The ``nrfdesktop-wheel-qdec`` DT alias support to :ref:`nrf_desktop_wheel`.
    You must use the alias to specify the QDEC instance used for scroll wheel, if your board supports multiple QDEC instances (for example ``nrf54l15pdk_nrf54l15_cpuapp``).
    You do not need to define the alias if your board supports only one QDEC instance, because in that case, the wheel module can rely on the ``qdec`` DT label provided by the board.

* Updated:

  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_TX_POWER_CORRECTION_VAL` Kconfig option value in the nRF52840 Gaming Mouse configurations with the Fast Pair support.
    The value is now aligned with the Fast Pair requirements.
  * Enabled the :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_CONFIG_CHANNEL_OUT_REPORT <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option for the nRF Desktop peripherals with :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu`.
    The option mitigates HID report rate drops during DFU image transfer through the nRF Desktop dongle.
    The output report is also enabled for the ``nrf52kbd_nrf52832`` build target in the debug configuration to maintain consistency with the release configuration.

Thingy:53: Matter weather station
---------------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Matter Bridge
-------------

* Added:

   The :ref:`CONFIG_BRIDGE_BT_MAX_SCANNED_DEVICES <CONFIG_BRIDGE_BT_MAX_SCANNED_DEVICES>` Kconfig option to set the maximum number of scanned Bluetooth LE devices.
   The :ref:`CONFIG_BRIDGE_BT_SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS <CONFIG_BRIDGE_BT_SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS>` Kconfig option to set the scan timeout.

* Updated the implementation of the persistent storage to leverage ``NonSecure``-prefixed methods from the common Persistent Storage module.
* Changed data structure of information stored in the persistent storage to use less settings keys.
  The new structure uses approximately 40% of the memory used by the old structure, and provides a new field to store user-specific data.

  Backward compatibility is kept by using an internal dedicated method that automatically detects the older data format and performs data migration to the new representation.
