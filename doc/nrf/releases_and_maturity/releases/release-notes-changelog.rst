See `Samples`_ for lists of changes for the protocol-related samples.

Amazon Sidewalk
---------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

BluetoothÂ® LE
-------------

* The correct SoftDevice Controller library :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_LL_SOFTDEVICE_MULTIROLE` will now be selected automatically when using coexistence based on :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MPSL_CX` for nRF52-series devices.
* Added the APIs :c:func:`bt_hci_err_to_str` and :c:func:`bt_security_err_to_str` to allow printing error codes as strings.
  Each API returns string representations of the error codes when the corresponding Kconfig option, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_HCI_ERR_TO_STR` or :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SECURITY_ERR_TO_STR`, is enabled.
  The :ref:`ble_samples` and :ref:`nrf53_audio_app` are updated to utilize these new APIs.
* The Bluetooth HCI driver is now present as a devicetree node in the device tree.
  The SoftDevice Controller driver uses a devicetree node named ``bt_hci_sdc`` with a devicetree binding compatible with ``nordic,bt-hci-sdc``.
  The Zephyr Bluetooth LE Controller uses a devicetree node named ``bt_hci_controller`` with a devicetree binding compatible with ``zephyr,bt-hci-ll-sw-split``.
  Applications using the Zephyr Bluetooth Controller need to be updated (see the :ref:`migration guide <migration_2.8>`).

Bluetooth Mesh
--------------

* Updated:

 * Added metadata as optional parameter for models Light Lightness Server, Light HSL Server, Light CTL Temperature Server, Sensor Server, and Time Server.
   To use the metadata, enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_LARGE_COMP_DATA_SRV` Kconfig option.

============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

Machine learning
----------------

* Added:

  * Support for sampling ADXL362 sensor from PPR core on the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20`.

Asset Tracker v2
----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Connectivity Bridge
-------------------

* Updated the new nrfx UARTE driver implementation by setting the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_UART_NRFX_UARTE_LEGACY_SHIM` Kconfig option to ``n``.
  This resolves an issue where data from UART0 ends up in UART1 sometimes after the device was reset.

IPC radio firmware
------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Matter Bridge
-------------

* Added:

  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NCS_SAMPLE_MATTER_ZAP_FILES_PATH` Kconfig option, which specifies ZAP files location for the application.
    By default, the option points to the :file:`src/default_zap` directory and can be changed to any path relative to application's location that contains the ZAP file and :file:`zap-generated` directory.
  * Experimental support for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20`.
  * Optional smart plug device functionality.
  * Experimental support for the Thread protocol.
  * Added :ref:`multiprotocol_bt_thread` page.

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

* Added:

  * The APIs :c:func:`bt_hci_err_to_str` and :c:func:`bt_security_err_to_str` that are used to allow printing error codes as strings.
    Each API returns string representations of the error codes when the corresponding Kconfig option, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_HCI_ERR_TO_STR` or :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SECURITY_ERR_TO_STR`, is enabled.

* Updated the :ref:`nrf53_audio_app_overview` documentation page with the :ref:`nrf53_audio_app_overview_files` section.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Added:

  * A debug configuration enabling the `Fast Pair`_ feature on the nRF54L15 PDK with the ``nrf54l15pdk/nrf54l15/cpuapp`` board target.
  * An application versioning using the :file:`VERSION` file.
    The versioning is only applied to the application configurations that use the MCUboot bootloader.
  * The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_USB_HID_REPORT_SENT_ON_SOF <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option to :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state`.
    The option allows to synchronize providing HID data with USB Start of Frame (SOF).
    The feature reduces the negative impact of jitter related to USB polls, but it also increases HID data latency.
    For details, see :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state_sof_synchronization`.
  * Local HID report buffering in :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state`.
    This ensures that the memory buffer passed to the USB next stack is valid until a HID report is sent and allows to enqueue up to two HID input reports for a USB HID instance (used only when :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_USB_HID_REPORT_SENT_ON_SOF <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option is enabled).
  * Kconfig dependency that prevents enabling USB remote wakeup (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_USB_REMOTE_WAKEUP <config_desktop_app_options>`) for the nRF54H20 SoC.
    The DWC2 USB device controller driver used by the nRF54H20 SoC does not support the remote wakeup capability.
  * Bootup logs with the manifest semantic version information to :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu_mcumgr` when the module is used for SUIT DFU and the SDFW supports semantic versioning (requires v0.6.2 and higher).
  * Manifest semantic version information to the firmware information response in :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu` when the module is used for SUIT DFU and the SDFW supports semantic versioning (requires v0.6.2 and higher).

* Updated:

  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_TX_POWER_CORRECTION_VAL` Kconfig option value in configurations with the Fast Pair support.
    The value is now aligned with the Fast Pair requirements.
  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_RRAM_WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE` Kconfig option value in the nRF54L15 PDK configurations to ensure short write slots.
    It prevents timeouts in the MPSL flash synchronization caused by allocating long write slots while maintaining a Bluetooth LE connection with short intervals and no connection latency.
  * The method of obtaining hardware ID using Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:hwinfo_api` on the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20`.
    Replaced the custom implementation of the :c:func:`z_impl_hwinfo_get_device_id` function in the nRF Desktop application with the native Zephyr driver function that now supports the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board target.
    Removed the ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_HWINFO_BLE_ADDRESS_FICR_POSTFIX`` Kconfig option as a postfix constant is no longer needed for the Zephyr native driver.
    The driver uses ``BLE.ADDR``, ``BLE.IR``, and ``BLE.ER`` fields of the Factory Information Configuration Registers (FICR) to provide 8 bytes of unique hardware ID.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu_mcumgr` to recognize the MCUmgr custom group ID (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MGMT_GROUP_ID_SUIT`) from the SUITFU subsystem (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MGMT_SUITFU`) as a DFU-related command group.

-----------------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Serial LTE modem
----------------

* Added:

  * DTLS support for the ``#XUDPSVR`` and ``#XSSOCKET`` (UDP server sockets) AT commands when the :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` configuration file is used.
  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SLM_PPP_FALLBACK_MTU` Kconfig option that is used to control the MTU used by PPP when the cellular link MTU is not returned by the modem in response to the ``AT+CGCONTRDP=0`` AT command.
  * Handler for new nRF Cloud event type ``NRF_CLOUD_EVT_RX_DATA_DISCON``.

* Removed:

  * Support for the :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` configuration file with the ``thingy91/nrf9160/ns`` board target.
  * Support for deprecated RAI socket options ``AT_SO_RAI_LAST``, ``AT_SO_RAI_NO_DATA``, ``AT_SO_RAI_ONE_RESP``, ``AT_SO_RAI_ONGOING``, and ``AT_SO_RAI_WAIT_MORE``.

* Updated:

  * AT string parsing to utilize the :ref:`at_parser_readme` library instead of the :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library.
  * The ``#XUDPCLI`` and ``#XSSOCKET`` (UDP client sockets) AT commands to use Zephyr's Mbed TLS with DTLS when the :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` configuration file is used.

Thingy:53: Matter weather station
---------------------------------

* Added:

  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NCS_SAMPLE_MATTER_ZAP_FILES_PATH` Kconfig option, which specifies ZAP files location for the application.
    By default, the option points to the :file:`src/default_zap` directory and can be changed to any path relative to application's location that contains the ZAP file and :file:`zap-generated` directory.

Binary libraries
----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Bluetooth libraries and services
--------------------------------

* :ref:`bt_fast_pair_readme` library:

  * Added:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_BN` Kconfig option that enables support for the Battery Notification extension.
      You must enable this option to access Fast Pair API elements associated with the Battery Notification extension.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_SUBSEQUENT_PAIRING` Kconfig option allowing the user to control the support for the Fast Pair subsequent pairing feature.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_USE_CASE` Kconfig choice option allowing the user to select their target Fast Pair use case.
      The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_USE_CASE_UNKNOWN`, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_USE_CASE_INPUT_DEVICE`, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_USE_CASE_LOCATOR_TAG` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_USE_CASE_MOUSE` Kconfig options represent the supported use cases that can be selected as part of this Kconfig choice option.

  * Removed:

    * The MbedTLS cryptographic backend support in Fast Pair, because it is superseded by the PSA backend.
      Consequently, the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_CRYPTO_MBEDTLS` Kconfig option has also been removed.
    * The default overrides for the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_DIS` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_DIS_FW_REV` Kconfig options that enable these options together with the Google Fast Pair Service.
      This configuration is now selected only by the Fast Pair use cases that require the Device Information Service (DIS).
    * The default override for the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_DIS_FW_REV_STR` Kconfig option that was set to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_IMGTOOL_SIGN_VERSION` if :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT` was enabled.
      The default override is now handled in the Kconfig of the Zephyr Device Information Service (DIS) module and is based on Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:app-version-details` that uses the :file:`VERSION` file.

  * Updated the default values of the following Fast Pair Kconfig options:

    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_SUBSEQUENT_PAIRING`
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_REQ_PAIRING`
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_PN`
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_GATT_SERVICE_MODEL_ID`

    These Kconfig options are now disabled by default and are selected only by the Fast Pair use cases that require them.

* :ref:`bt_le_adv_prov_readme`:

  * Updated the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_FAST_PAIR_SHOW_UI_PAIRING` Kconfig option and the :c:func:`bt_le_adv_prov_fast_pair_show_ui_pairing` function to require the enabling of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_SUBSEQUENT_PAIRING` Kconfig option.
  * Added the :c:member:`bt_le_adv_prov_adv_state.adv_handle` field to the :c:struct:`bt_le_adv_prov_adv_state` structure to store the advertising handle.
    If the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_EXT_ADV` Kconfig option is enabled, you can use the :c:func:`bt_hci_get_adv_handle` function to obtain the advertising handle for the advertising set that employs :ref:`bt_le_adv_prov_readme`.
    If the Kconfig option is disabled, the :c:member:`bt_le_adv_prov_adv_state.adv_handle` field must be set to ``0``.
    This field is currently used by the TX Power provider (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_TX_POWER`).

Modem libraries
---------------

* Added:

   * The :ref:`at_parser_readme` library.
     The :ref:`at_parser_readme` is a library that parses AT command responses, notifications, and events.
     Compared to the deprecated :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library, it does not allocate memory dynamically and has a smaller footprint.
     For more information on how to transition from the :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library to the :ref:`at_parser_readme` library, see the :ref:`migration guide <migration_2.8_recommended>`.

* :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library:

  * Deprecated:

    * The :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library in favor of the :ref:`at_parser_readme` library.
      The :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library will be removed in a future version.
      For more information on how to transition from the :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library to the :ref:`at_parser_readme` library, see the :ref:`migration guide <migration_2.8_recommended>`.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_AT_CMD_PARSER`.
      This option will be removed in a future version.

  * Renamed the :c:func:`at_parser_cmd_type_get` function to :c:func:`at_parser_at_cmd_type_get` to prevent a name collision.

* :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library:

  * Removed:

    * The :c:func:`lte_lc_init` function.
      All instances of this function can be removed without any additional actions.

Libraries for networking
------------------------

* :ref:`lib_lwm2m_client_utils` library:

  * Updated to use the :ref:`at_parser_readme` library instead of the :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_rest` library:

  * Added the function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_rest_shadow_transform_request` to request shadow data using a JSONata expression.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:

  * Added:

    * The function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_client_id_runtime_set` to set the device ID string if the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_CLIENT_ID_SRC_RUNTIME` Kconfig option is enabled.
    * The functions :c:func:`nrf_cloud_sec_tag_set` and :c:func:`nrf_cloud_sec_tag_get` to set and get the sec tag used for nRF Cloud credentials.
    * A new nRF Cloud event type ``NRF_CLOUD_EVT_RX_DATA_DISCON`` which is generated when a device is deleted from nRF Cloud.
    * The function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_print_details` to log common nRF Cloud connection information in a uniform way.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_VERBOSE_DETAILS` Kconfig option to enable the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_print_details` function to print all details instead of only the device ID.

  * Updated:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_CLIENT_ID_SRC_RUNTIME` Kconfig option to be available with CoAP and REST.
    * The JSON string representing longitude in ``PVT`` reports from ``lng`` to ``lon`` to align with nRF Cloud.
      nRF Cloud still accepts ``lng`` for backward compatibility.
    * The handling of MQTT JITP device association to improve speed and reliability.
    * To use nRF Cloud's custom MQTT topics instead of the default AWS topics.
    * MQTT and CoAP transports to use a single unified DNS lookup mechanism that supports IPv4 and IPv6, fallback to IPv4, and handling of multiple addresses returned by :c:func:`getaddrinfo`.

  * Deprecated:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_IPV6` Kconfig option, which now no longer forces the nRF Cloud MQTT transport to use IPv4 when not enabled.
      Instead, use the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NET_IPV4` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NET_IPV6` Kconfig options to customize which IP versions the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library uses.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_STATIC_IPV4` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_STATIC_IPV4_ADDR` Kconfig options.
      Support for statically configured nRF Cloud IP Addresses will soon be removed.
      Leave :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_STATIC_IPV4` disabled to instead use automatic DNS lookup.

  * Fixed an issue in the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_send` function that prevented data in the provided :c:struct:`nrf_cloud_obj` structure from being sent to the bulk and bin topics.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_coap` library:

  * Fixed:

    * A hard fault that occurred when encoding AGNSS request data and the ``net_info`` field of the :c:struct:`nrf_cloud_rest_agnss_request` structure is NULL.
    * An issue where certain CoAP functions could return zero, indidicating success, even though there was an error.

  * Updated:

    * To use a shorter resource string for the ``d2c/bulk`` resource.
    * The function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_coap_shadow_get` to return ``-E2BIG`` if the received shadow data was truncated because the provided buffer was not big enough.

* :ref:`lib_lwm2m_client_utils` library:

  * Fixed an issue where a failed delta update for the modem would not clear the state and blocks future delta updates.
    This only occurred when an LwM2M Firmware object was used in push mode.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_log` library:

  * Added support for dictionary logs using REST.
  * Added support for dictionary (binary) logs when connected to nRF Cloud using CoAP.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_fota` library:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_FOTA_DOWNLOAD_FRAGMENT_SIZE` Kconfig option to be available and used also when the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_FOTA_POLL` Kconfig option is enabled.
      The range of the option is now from 128 to 1900 bytes, and the default value is 1700 bytes.
    * The function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_fota_poll_process` to be used asynchrounously if a callback to handle errors is provided.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_provisioning` library:

  * Added support for the ``SO_KEEPOPEN`` socket option to keep the socket open even during PDN disconnect and reconnect.

Libraries for NFC
-----------------

* Added an experimental serialization of NFC tag 2 and tag 4 APIs.
* Fixed a potential issue with handling data pointers in the function ``ring_buf_get_data`` in the :file:`platform_internal_thread` file.

nRF RPC libraries
-----------------

* Updated the internal Bluetooth serialization API and Bluetooth callback proxy API to become part of the public NRF RPC API.
* Added:

  * An experimental serialization of Openthread APIs.
  * The logging backend that sends logs through nRF RPC events.

---------------

* Added a compression/decompression library with support for the LZMA decompression.
* :ref:`lib_date_time` library:

  * Fixed a bug that caused date-time updates to not be rescheduled under certain circumstances.

  * Added:

    * A retry feature that reattempts failed date-time updates up to a certain number of consecutive times.
    * The Kconfig options :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DATE_TIME_RETRY_COUNT` to control whether and how many consecutive date-time update retries may be performed, and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DATE_TIME_RETRY_INTERVAL_SECONDS` to control how quickly date-time update retries occur.

* :ref:`lib_ram_pwrdn` library:

  * Added support for the nRF54L15 SoC.
