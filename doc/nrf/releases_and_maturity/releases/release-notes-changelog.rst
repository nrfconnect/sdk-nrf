-------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Bluetooth Mesh
--------------

* Updated the NLC profile configuration system:

  * Introduced individual profile configuration options for better user control.
  * Deprecated the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_NLC_PERF_CONF` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_NLC_PERF_DEFAULT` Kconfig options.
    Existing configurations continue to work but you should migrate to individual profile options.

DECT NR+

Applications
============

|no_changes_yet_note|

Connectivity bridge
-------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

IPC radio firmware
------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Matter bridge
-------------

* Updated the application to store a portion of the application code related to the nRF70 Series Wi-Fi firmware in the external flash memory by default.
  This change breaks the DFU between the previous |NCS| versions and the |NCS| v3.2.0.
  To fix this, you need to disable storing the Wi-Fi firmware patch in external memory.
  See the :ref:`migration guide <migration_3.2_required>` for more information.

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

* Added:

  * A way to store servers in RAM on the unicast client (gateway) side.
    The storage does a compare on server address to match multiple servers in a unicast group.
    This means that if another device appears with the same address, it will be treated as the same server.
  * Experimental support for stereo in :ref:`unicast server application<nrf53_audio_unicast_server_app_configuration_stereo>`.
  * The :ref:`Audio application API documentation <audio_api>` page.
  * The :ref:`config_audio_app_options` page.
  * The API documentation in the header files listed on the :ref:`audio_api` page.
  * Ability to connect by address as a unicast client.

* Updated:

  * The unicast client (gateway) application has been rewritten to support N channels.
  * The unicast client (gateway) application now checks if a server has a resolvable address.
    If this has not been resolved, the discovery process will start in the identity resolved callback.
  * The power measurements to be disabled by default in the default debug versions of the applications.
    To enable power measurements, see :ref:`nrf53_audio_app_configuration_power_measurements`.
  * The audio application targeting the :zephyr:board:`nrf5340dk` to use pins **P1.5** to **P1.9** for the I2S interface instead of **P0.13** to **P0.17**.
    This change was made to avoid conflicts with the onboard peripherals on the nRF5340 DK.
  * The documentation pages with information about the :ref:`SD card playback module <nrf53_audio_app_overview_architecture_sd_card_playback>` and :ref:`how to enable it <nrf53_audio_app_configuration_sd_card_playback>`.
  * The API documentation in the header files listed on the :ref:`audio_api` page.

* Removed the LC3 QDID from the :ref:`nrf53_audio_feature_support` page.
  The QDID is now listed in the `nRF5340 Bluetooth DNs and QDIDs Compatibility Matrix`_.

nRF Desktop
-----------

  * Updated:

    * The memory layouts for the ``nrf54lm20dk/nrf54lm20a/cpuapp`` board target to make more space for the application code.
      This change in the partition map of every nRF54LM20 configuration is a breaking change and cannot be performed using DFU.
      As a result, the DFU procedure will fail if you attempt to upgrade the application firmware based on one of the |NCS| v3.1 releases.
    * The application and MCUboot configurations for the ``nrf54lm20dk/nrf54lm20a/cpuapp`` board target to use the CRACEN hardware crypto driver instead of the Oberon software crypto driver.
      The application image signature is verified with the CRACEN hardware peripheral.
    * The MCUboot configurations for the ``nrf54lm20dk/nrf54lm20a/cpuapp`` board target to use the KMU-based key storage.
      The public key used by MCUboot for validating the application image is securely stored in the KMU hardware peripheral.
      To simplify the programming procedure, the application is configured to use the automatic KMU provisioning.
      The KMU provisioning is performed by the west runner as a part of the ``west flash`` command when the ``--erase`` or ``--recover`` flag is used.
    * Application configurations to avoid using the deprecated Kconfig options :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_HID_REPORT_EXPIRATION <config_desktop_app_options>` and :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_HID_EVENT_QUEUE_SIZE <config_desktop_app_options>`.
      The configurations rely on Kconfig options specific to HID providers instead.
      The HID keypress queue sizes for HID consumer control (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_HID_REPORT_PROVIDER_CONSUMER_CTRL_EVENT_QUEUE_SIZE <config_desktop_app_options>`) and HID system control (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_HID_REPORT_PROVIDER_SYSTEM_CTRL_EVENT_QUEUE_SIZE <config_desktop_app_options>`) reports were decreased to ``10``.
    * Application configurations integrating the USB legacy stack (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_USB_STACK_LEGACY <config_desktop_app_options>`) to suppress build warnings related to deprecated APIs of the USB legacy stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_STACK`).
      The configurations enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DEPRECATION_TEST` Kconfig option to suppress the deprecation warnings.
      The USB legacy stack is still used by default.
    * MCUboot configurations that support serial recovery over USB CDC ACM to enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DEPRECATION_TEST` Kconfig option to suppress deprecation warnings.
      The implementation of serial recovery over USB CDC ACM still uses the deprecated APIs of the USB legacy stack (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_STACK`).
    * Configurations of the ``nrf52840dongle/nrf52840`` board target to align them after the ``bare`` variant of the board was introduced in Zephyr.
      The application did not switch to the ``bare`` board variant to keep backwards compatibility.
    * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_state` to allow for delayed registration of HID report providers.
      Before the change was introduced, subscribing to a HID input report before the respective provider was registered triggered an assertion failure.
    * HID transports (:ref:`nrf_desktop_hids`, :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state`) to use the early :c:struct:`hid_report_event` subscription (:c:macro:`APP_EVENT_SUBSCRIBE_EARLY`).
      This update improves the reception speed of HID input reports in HID transports.
    * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_motion` implementations to align internal state names for consistency.
    * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_motion` implementation that generates simulated motion.
      Improved the Zephyr shell (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SHELL`) integration to prevent potential race conditions related to using preemptive execution context for shell commands.
    * The :c:struct:`motion_event` to include information if the sensor is still active or goes to idle state waiting for user activity (:c:member:`motion_event.active`).
      The newly added field is filled by all :ref:`nrf_desktop_motion` implementations.
      The :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_provider_mouse` uses the newly added field to improve the synchronization of motion sensor sampling.
      After the motion sensor sampling is triggered, the provider waits for the result before submitting a subsequent HID mouse input report.
    * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_state_pm` to skip submitting the :c:struct:`keep_alive_event` if the :c:enum:`POWER_MANAGER_LEVEL_ALIVE` power level is enforced by any application module through the :c:struct:`power_manager_restrict_event`.
      This is done to improve performance.
    * The documentation of the :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_state` and default HID report providers to simplify getting started with updating HID input reports used by the application or introducing support for a new HID input report.

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

* Updated the application to change the default libc from the :ref:`zephyr:c_library_newlib` to the :ref:`zephyr:c_library_picolibc` to align with the |NCS| and Zephyr.

* Removed support for the ``thingy53/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns`` build target.

Serial LTE modem
----------------

* Updated to use the new ``SEC_TAG_TLS_INVALID`` definition as a placeholder for security tags.


Thingy:53: Matter weather station
---------------------------------

Samples
=======

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`sample <samples>`.

Bluetooth samples
-----------------

* Added the :ref:`samples_test_app` application to demonstrate how to use the Bluetooth LE Test GATT Server and test Bluetooth LE functionality in peripheral samples.

* Updated the network core image applications for the following samples from the :zephyr:code-sample:`bluetooth_hci_ipc` sample to the :ref:`ipc_radio` application for multicore builds:

  * :ref:`bluetooth_conn_time_synchronization`
  * :ref:`bluetooth_iso_combined_bis_cis`
  * :ref:`bluetooth_isochronous_time_synchronization`
  * :ref:`bt_scanning_while_connecting`
  * :ref:`channel_sounding_ras_initiator`
  * :ref:`channel_sounding_ras_reflector`

  The :ref:`ipc_radio` application is commonly used for multicore builds in other |NCS| samples and projects.
  Hence, this is to align with the common practice.

* Removed support for the ``thingy53/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns`` build target from the following samples:

   * :ref:`peripheral_lbs`
   * :ref:`peripheral_status`
   * :ref:`peripheral_uart`

* Disabled legacy pairing in the following samples:

   * :ref:`central_nfc_pairing`
   * :ref:`power_profiling`

   Support for legacy pairing remains exclusively for :ref:`peripheral_nfc_pairing` sample to retain compatibility with older Andorid devices.

* :ref:`direct_test_mode` sample:

  * Updated by simplifying the 2-wire UART polling.
    This is done by replacing the hardware timer with the ``k_sleep()`` function.

Bluetooth Mesh samples
----------------------

* Added external flash settings support for the ``nrf52840dk/nrf52840`` board targets in all Bluetooth Mesh samples.

* :ref:`ble_mesh_dfu_distributor` sample:

   * Added:

    * Support for external flash memory for the ``nrf52840dk/nrf52840`` and the ``nrf54l15dk/nrf54l15/cpuapp`` as the secondary partition for the DFU process.
    * Support for external flash settings for the ``nrf52840dk/nrf52840`` board targets.

  * Updated the :makevar:`FILE_SUFFIX` make variable to use more descriptive suffixes for external flash configurations.
    The new suffixes are ``_dfu_ext_flash`` for external flash DFU storage and ``_ext_flash_settings`` for external flash settings storage.

* :ref:`ble_mesh_dfu_target` sample:

  * Added:

    * Support for external flash memory for the ``nrf52840dk/nrf52840`` and the ``nrf54l15dk/nrf54l15/cpuapp`` as the secondary partition for the DFU process.
    * Support for external flash settings for the ``nrf52840dk/nrf52840`` board targets.

  * Updated the :makevar:`FILE_SUFFIX` make variable to use more descriptive suffixes for external flash configurations.
    The new suffixes are ``_dfu_ext_flash`` for external flash DFU storage and ``_ext_flash_settings`` for external flash settings storage.

* :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_sensor_client` sample:

  * Added polling toggle to **Button 1** (**Button 0** on nRF54 DKs) to start/stop the periodic Sensor Get loop, ensuring the functionality is available on all supported devices including single-button hardware.

  * Updated:

    * To demonstrate the Bluetooth :ref:`ug_bt_mesh_nlc` HVAC Integration profile.
    * The following Mesh samples to use individual NLC profile configurations instead of the deprecated options:

      * :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_light_dim`
      * :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_light_lc`
      * :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_sensor_server`
      * :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_sensor_client`

    * Button functions.
      Assignments are shifted down one index to accommodate the new polling toggle.
      The descriptor action has been removed from button actions but is still available through mesh shell commands.

  * Removed support for the ``nrf52dk/nrf52832``, since it does not have enough RAM space after NLC support was added.

Bluetooth Fast Pair samples
---------------------------

* :ref:`fast_pair_locator_tag` sample:

  * Updated:

    * The memory layout for the ``nrf54lm20dk/nrf54lm20a/cpuapp`` board target to make more space for the application code.
      This change in the nRF54LM20 partition map is a breaking change and cannot be performed using DFU.
      As a result, the DFU procedure will fail if you attempt to upgrade the sample firmware based on one of the |NCS| v3.1 releases.
    * The application and MCUBoot configurations for the ``nrf54lm20dk/nrf54lm20a/cpuapp`` board target to use the CRACEN hardware crypto driver instead of the Oberon software crypto driver.
      Note, that the Fast Pair subsystem still uses the Oberon software library.
      The application image signature is verified with the CRACEN hardware peripheral.
    * The MCUBoot configuration for the ``nrf54lm20dk/nrf54lm20a/cpuapp`` board target to use the KMU-based key storage.
      The public key used by MCUboot for validating the application image is securely stored in the KMU hardware peripheral.
      To simplify the programming procedure, the samples are configured to use the automatic KMU provisioning.
      The KMU provisioning is performed by the west runner as a part of the ``west flash`` command when the ``--erase`` or ``--recover`` flag is used.

* :ref:`fast_pair_input_device` sample:

  * Updated the application configuration for the ``nrf54lm20dk/nrf54lm20a/cpuapp`` board target to use the CRACEN hardware crypto driver instead of the Oberon software crypto driver.
    Note, that the Fast Pair subsystem still uses the Oberon software library.

* :ref:`nrf_cloud_multi_service` sample:

  * Fixed an issue where sporadically the application was stuck waiting for the device to connect to the internet.
    This was due to wrong :ref:`Connection Manager <zephyr:conn_mgr_overview>` initialization.

Cryptography samples
--------------------

* Added:

  * Support for the ``nrf54lv10dk/nrf54lv10a/cpuapp`` and ``nrf54lv10dk/nrf54lv10a/cpuapp/ns`` board targets to all samples (except :ref:`crypto_test`).

* Updated:

  * All Matter over Wi-Fi samples and applications to store a portion of the application code related to the nRF70 Series Wi-Fi firmware in the external flash memory by default.
    This change breaks the DFU between the previous |NCS| versions and the |NCS| v3.2.0.
    To fix this, you need to disable storing the Wi-Fi firmware patch in external memory.
    See the :ref:`migration guide <migration_3.2_required>` for more information.
  * All Matter samples that support low-power mode to use the :ref:`lib_ram_pwrdn` feature with the nRF54LM20 DK.

    * Sending of the ``LTE_LC_EVT_PSM_UPDATE`` event with ``tau`` and ``active_time`` set to ``-1`` when registration status is ``LTE_LC_NW_REG_NOT_REGISTERED``.
    * New registration statuses and functional modes for the ``mfw_nrf9151-ntn`` modem firmware.

  * Updated:

    * The type of the :c:member:`lte_lc_evt.modem_evt` field to :c:struct:`lte_lc_modem_evt`.
    * Replaced modem events ``LTE_LC_MODEM_EVT_CE_LEVEL_0``, ``LTE_LC_MODEM_EVT_CE_LEVEL_1``, ``LTE_LC_MODEM_EVT_CE_LEVEL_2`` and ``LTE_LC_MODEM_EVT_CE_LEVEL_3`` with the :c:enumerator:`LTE_LC_MODEM_EVT_CE_LEVEL` modem event.
    * The order of the ``LTE_LC_MODEM_EVT_SEARCH_DONE`` modem event, and registration and cell related events.
      See the :ref:`migration guide <migration_3.2_required>` for more information.

* :ref:`nrf_modem_lib_readme` library:

  * Added the :c:func:`nrf_modem_lib_trace_peek_at` function to the :c:struct:`nrf_modem_lib_trace_backend` interface to peek trace data at a byte offset without consuming it.
    Support for this API has been added to the flash trace backend.

* :ref:`pdn_readme` library:

  * Fixed:

    * An issue where wrong APN rate control event was sent.
    * An issue where a malformed +CGEV notification was not handled correctly.

Multiprotocol Service Layer libraries
-------------------------------------

Libraries for networking
------------------------

* Added missing brackets that caused C++ compilation to fail in the following libraries:

  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_pgps`
  * :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_fota`

* Updated the following libraries to use the new ``SEC_TAG_TLS_INVALID`` definition for checking whether a security tag is valid:

  * :ref:`lib_aws_fota`
  * :ref:`lib_fota_download`
  * :ref:`lib_ftp_client`

* Removed the Download client library.
  Use the :ref:`lib_downloader` library instead.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_provisioning` library:

  * Added a blocking call to wait for a functional-mode change, relocating the logic from the app into the library.

  * Updated:

    * By making internal scheduling optional.
      Applications can now trigger provisioning manually using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_PROVISIONING_SCHEDULED` Kconfig option.
    * By moving root CA provisioning to modem initialization callback to avoid blocking and ensure proper state.
    * By expanding the event handler to report more provisioning events, including failures.
    * By making the event handler callback mandatory to notify the application of failures and prevent silent errors.
    * By unifying the device‐mode and modem‐mode callbacks into a single handler for cleaner integration.
    * The documentation and sample code accordingly.

  * Fixed multiple bugs and enhanced error handling.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_rest` library:

  * Deprecated the library.
    Use the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_coap` library instead.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_fota` library:

  * Fixed occasional message truncation notifying that the download was complete.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_log` library:

  * Updated by adding a missing CONFIG prefix.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:

  * Added the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_obj_location_request_create_timestamped` function to make location requests for past cellular or Wi-Fi scans.
  * Updated by refactoring the folder structure of the library to separate the different backend implementations.

* :ref:`lib_downloader` library:

  * Fixed an issue where HTTP download would hang if the application had not set the socket receive timeout and data flow from the server stopped.
    The HTTP transport now sets the socket receive timeout to 30 seconds by default.

See the changelog for each library in the :doc:`nrfxlib documentation <nrfxlib:README>` for additional information.

Scripts
=======

* Added:

  * The :ref:`esb_sniffer_scripts` scripts for the :ref:`esb_monitor` sample.
  * The documentation page for :ref:`nrf_profiler_script`.
    The page also describes the script for calculating statistics (:file:`calc_stats.py`).

Integrations
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`integration <integrations>`.

Google Fast Pair integration
----------------------------

* Removed the Fast Pair TinyCrypt cryptographic backend (``CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_CRYPTO_TINYCRYPT``), because the TinyCrypt library support was removed from Zephyr.
  You can use either the Fast Pair Oberon cryptographic backend (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_CRYPTO_OBERON`) or the Fast Pair PSA cryptographic backend (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_CRYPTO_PSA`).

Edge Impulse integration
------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Memfault integration
--------------------

* Updated:

  * The ``CONFIG_MEMFAULT_DEVICE_INFO_CUSTOM`` Kconfig option has been renamed to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_DEVICE_INFO_CUSTOM`.
  * The ``CONFIG_MEMFAULT_DEVICE_INFO_BUILTIN`` Kconfig option has been renamed to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_DEVICE_INFO_BUILTIN`.

* Added a metric tracking the unused stack space of the Bluetooth Long workqueue thread, when the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_BT_METRICS` Kconfig option is enabled.
  The new metric is named ``ncs_bt_lw_wq_unused_stack``.

* Removed a metric for the tracking Bluetooth TX thread unused stack ``ncs_bt_tx_unused_stack``.
  The thread in question was removed in Zephyr v3.7.0.

MCUboot
=======

The MCUboot fork in |NCS| (``sdk-mcuboot``) contains all commits from the upstream MCUboot repository up to and including ``81315483fcbdf1f1524c2b34a1fd4de6c77cd0f4``, with some |NCS| specific additions.

The code for integrating MCUboot into |NCS| is located in the :file:`ncs/nrf/modules/mcuboot` folder.

The following list summarizes both the main changes inherited from upstream MCUboot and the main changes applied to the |NCS| specific additions:

* Added support for S2RAM resume on nRF54H20 devices.
  MCUboot acts as the S2RAM resume mediator and redirects execution to the application's native resume routine.

* Updated KMU mapping to ``BL_PUBKEY`` when MCUboot is used as the immutable bootloader for nRF54L Series devices.
  You can restore the previous KMU mapping (``UROT_PUBKEY``) with the :kconfig:option:`SB_CONFIG_MCUBOOT_SIGNATURE_KMU_UROT_MAPPING` Kconfig option.

Zephyr
======

.. NOTE TO MAINTAINERS: All the Zephyr commits in the below git commands must be handled specially after each upmerge and each nRF Connect SDK release.
