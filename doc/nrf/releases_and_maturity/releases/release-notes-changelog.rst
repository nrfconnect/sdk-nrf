Bluetooth® LE
-------------

* Updated the Direct Test Mode HCI commands by making them optional through the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_DTM_HCI` Kconfig option.

Bluetooth Mesh
--------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

Connectivity bridge
-------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

IPC radio firmware
------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Matter bridge
-------------

* Updated partitions mapping for the nRF7002 DK in the application.
  See the :ref:`migration guide <migration_3.3_required>` for more information.

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

* Added:

  * Dynamic configuration of the number of channels for the encoder based on the configured audio locations.
    The number of channels is set during runtime using the :c:func:`audio_system_encoder_num_ch_set` function.
    This allows configuring mono or stereo encoding depending on the configured audio locations, potentially saving CPU and memory resources.

  * High CPU load callback using the Zephyr CPU load subsystem.
    The callback uses a :c:func:`printk` function, as the logging subsystem is scheduled out if higher priority threads take all CPU time.
    This makes debugging high CPU load situations easier in the application.
    The threshold for high CPU load is set in :file:`peripherals.c` using :c:macro:`CPU_LOAD_HIGH_THRESHOLD_PERCENT`.

  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SPEED_OPTIMIZATIONS` to enable compiler speed optimizations for the application.

* Updated:

  * Switched to the new USB stack introduced in Zephyr 3.4.0.
    For an end user, this change requires no action.
    macOS will now work out of the box, fixing OCT-2154.

  * Programming script.
    Devices are now halted before programming.
    Furthermore, the devices are kept halted until they are all programmed, and then started together
    with the headsets starting first.
    This eases sniffing of advertisement packets.

  * With the latest release of |nRFVSC|, you can build and program the nRF5340 Audio application using the |nRFVSC| GUI.
    Updated the :ref:`nrf53_audio_app_building` accordingly: the note about missing support in |nRFVSC| has been removed and the section about programming using standard methods now lists the steps for |nRFVSC| and the command line.

  * Improved handling of I2S RX buffer overruns.
    When an overrun occurs, the most recent block in the current frame is removed to make space for new incoming data.

  * Optimized USB-to-encoder audio processing pipeline to reduce CPU usage.
    Note that LC3-encoding of sinusoidal input demands more of the CPU than real-world audio input.

  * The audio data path now accumulates 10 ms frames instead of processing 1 ms blocks individually, reducing message queue operations by 90% and improving overall system performance.
    This optimization affects both USB audio input processing and the I2S audio datapath, resulting in more efficient encoder thread operation.

  * Improved error handling with ``unlikely()`` macros for better branch prediction in performance-critical paths.

  * Removed the Bluetooth controller watchdog from the application.
    The watchdog was not providing value and the removal allows for easier porting to other platforms that do not have a multi-core architecture.

  * Separated the audio clock configuration into a dedicated module.
    This allows for better organization and potential reuse of the audio clock configuration code between different SoCs that might not have the high-frequency audio clock (HFCLKAUDIO) feature.
    The new module provides an initialization function for setting up the audio clock and a function for configuring the audio clock frequency.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Added:

  * A workaround for the USB next stack race issue where the application could try to submit HID reports while the USB is being disabled after USB cable has been unplugged, which results in an error.
    The workaround is applied when the :option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_USB_STACK_NEXT_DISABLE_ON_VBUS_REMOVAL` Kconfig option is enabled.
  * Support for the ``nrf54lv10dk/nrf54lv10a/cpuapp`` board target.
  * Application-specific Kconfig options that simplify using SEGGER J-Link RTT (:option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_LOG_RTT`) or UART (:option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_LOG_UART`) as logging backend used by the application (:option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_LOG`).
    The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_UART` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_RTT` Kconfig options are no longer enabled by default if nRF Desktop logging (:option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_LOG`) is enabled.
    These options are controlled through the newly introduced nRF Desktop application-specific Kconfig options.
    The application still uses SEGGER J-Link RTT as the default logging backend.
  * Support for the ``nrf54ls05dk/nrf54ls05b/cpuapp`` board target.

* Updated:

  * The :option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BT` Kconfig option to no longer select the deprecated :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SIGNING` Kconfig option.
    The application relies on Bluetooth LE security mode 1 and security level of at least 2 to ensure data confidentiality through encryption.
  * The memory map for RAM load configurations of nRF54LM20 target to increase KMU RAM section size to allow for secp384r1 key.
  * The default log levels used by the legacy USB stack (:option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_USB_STACK_LEGACY`) to enable error logs (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_LOG_LEVEL_ERR`, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USB_DRIVER_LOG_LEVEL_ERR`).
    Previously, the legacy USB stack logs were turned off.
    This change ensures visibility of runtime issues.
  * Application configurations that emit debug logs over UART to use the :option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_LOG_UART` Kconfig option instead of explicitly configuring the logger.
    This is done to simplify the configurations.

* Removed the application-specific Kconfig option (``CONFIG_DESKTOP_RTT``) that enabled RTT for nRF Desktop logging (:option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_LOG`) or nRF Desktop shell (:option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_SHELL`).
  nRF Desktop shell automatically enables RTT by default (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT`).
  You can use the newly introduced application-specific Kconfig option :option:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_LOG_RTT` for nRF Desktop RTT logging configuration.
  By default, this option makes the RTT log backend block the message until it is transferred to host (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_RTT_MODE_BLOCK`) instead of dropping messages that do not fit in up-buffer (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_RTT_MODE_DROP`).
  This is done to prevent dropping the newest logs.

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

* Deprecated the :ref:`nrf_machine_learning_app` application.
  Replaced by the Gesture Recognition application in `Edge AI Add-on for nRF Connect SDK`_.

Thingy:53: Matter weather station
---------------------------------
