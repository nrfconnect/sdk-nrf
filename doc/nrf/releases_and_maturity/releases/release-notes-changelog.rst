  .. note::
     This feature has never been functional.
     To configure the signing key, use any available Kconfig method.

* Deprecated the following devicetree properties:

  * ``owner-id``
  * ``perm-read``
  * ``perm-write``
  * ``perm-execute``
  * ``perm-secure``
  * ``non-secure-callable``

  It is recommended to replace them with the new devicetree property: ``nordic,access``.
  See the :ref:`migration guide <migration_2.8_recommended>` for more information.

* Removed the non-working support for configuring the NSIB signing key through the environmental or command line variable (``SB_SIGNING_KEY_FILE``) along with child image.

  .. note::
     This feature has never been functional.
     To configure the signing key, use any available Kconfig method.

  * TF-M support from the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54l15pdk_nrf54l15` (board target ``nrf54l15pdk/nrf54l15/cpuapp/ns``).

Protocols
=========

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`protocol <protocols>`.
See `Samples`_ for lists of changes for the protocol-related samples.

Amazon Sidewalk
---------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

BluetoothÂ® LE
-------------

* Added functions :c:func:`bt_hci_err_to_str` and :c:func:`bt_security_err_to_str` to allow printing error codes as strings.
  Each function returns string representations of the error codes when the corresponding Kconfig option, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_HCI_ERR_TO_STR` or :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SECURITY_ERR_TO_STR`, is enabled.
  The :ref:`ble_samples` and :ref:`nrf53_audio_app` are updated to use these new functions.

* Updated:

  * The SoftDevice Controller library to automatically select the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_LL_SOFTDEVICE_MULTIROLE` Kconfig option when using coexistence based on :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MPSL_CX` for nRF52 Series devices.
  * The Bluetooth HCI driver is now present as a devicetree node in the device tree.
    The SoftDevice Controller driver uses a devicetree node named ``bt_hci_sdc`` with a devicetree binding compatible with ``nordic,bt-hci-sdc``.
    The Zephyr Bluetooth LE Controller uses a devicetree node named ``bt_hci_controller`` with a devicetree binding compatible with ``zephyr,bt-hci-ll-sw-split``.
    You need to update applications using the Zephyr Bluetooth Controller (see the :ref:`migration guide <migration_2.8>`).
  * Host calls in GATT Discovery Manager (DM) callbacks are now scheduled in a workqueue.
    The :kconfig:option:`BT_GATT_DM_WORKQ_CHOICE` Kconfig option allows you to select the workqueue implementation.
    You can select either a workqueue specific to GATT DM (default) or the system workqueue.
    You can use the system workqueue if creating a new thread is not viable due to memory constraints, but it is not recommended to have potential blocking calls in the system workqueue.

* Fixed an issue where the Bluetooth subsystem deadlocked when a Bluetooth link was lost during data transfer.
  In this scenario, the disconnected event was never delivered to the application.
  The issue only occurred when the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_HCI_ACL_FLOW_CONTROL` Kconfig option was enabled.
  This option is enabled by default on the nRF5340 DK.

Bluetooth Mesh
--------------

* Added metadata as optional parameter for models Light Lightness Server, Light HSL Server, Light CTL Temperature Server, Sensor Server, and Time Server.
  To use the metadata, enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_LARGE_COMP_DATA_SRV` Kconfig option.

* Removed the ``BT_MESH_SENSOR_USE_LEGACY_SENSOR_VALUE`` Kconfig option, deprecated in the |NCS| v2.6.0, as the old APIs, based on the :c:struct:`sensor_value` type, are removed.
  You need to update applications using the old APIs, as described in the :ref:`v2.6.0 migration guide <nrf5340_audio_migration_notes>`.

DECT NR+

Matter
------

* Added:

  * The following Kconfig options to configure parameters impacting persistent subscriptions re-establishment:

    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_MAX_ACTIVE_CASE_CLIENTS`
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_MAX_ACTIVE_DEVICES`
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_SUBSCRIPTION_RESUMPTION_MIN_RETRY_INTERVAL`
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_SUBSCRIPTION_RESUMPTION_RETRY_MULTIPLIER`

  * The :ref:`ug_matter_device_memory_profiling` section to the :ref:`ug_matter_device_optimizing_memory` page.
    The section contains useful commands for measuring memory and troubleshooting tips.
  * The ZMS file subsystem to all devices that contain RRAM, such as the nRF54L Series devices.
  * Migration of the Device Attestation Certificates private key to Key Management Unit (KMU) for the nRF54L Series SoCs.
    See :ref:`matter_platforms_security_dac_priv_key_kmu` to learn how to enable it in your sample.

* Updated:

  * The default Trusted Storage AEAD key to Hardware Unique Key (HUK) for supported nRF54L Series devices.
  * Renamed the ``CONFIG_CHIP_FACTORY_RESET_ERASE_NVS`` Kconfig option to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_FACTORY_RESET_ERASE_SETTINGS`.
    The new Kconfig option now works for both NVS and ZMS file system backends.
  * The firmware version format used for informational purposes when using the :file:`VERSION` file.
    The format now includes the optional ``EXTRAVERSION`` component.
  * Storing the Device Attestation Certificates private key in the Trusted Storage library to be enabled for all platforms that support the PSA crypto API.
    See :ref:`matter_platforms_security_dac_priv_key_its` for more information.

Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

Machine learning
----------------

* Added support for sampling ADXL362 sensor from PPR core on the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20`.

Asset Tracker v2
----------------

* Added a note that the :ref:`asset_tracker_v2` application is in the maintenance mode and recommended to use the :ref:`nrf_cloud_multi_service` sample instead.

Connectivity Bridge
-------------------

* Updated the new nrfx UARTE driver implementation by setting the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_UART_NRFX_UARTE_LEGACY_SHIM` Kconfig option to ``n``.
  This resolves an issue where data from UART0 ends up in UART1 sometimes after the device was reset.

IPC radio firmware
------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Matter Bridge
-------------

* Added:

  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NCS_SAMPLE_MATTER_ZAP_FILES_PATH` Kconfig option that specifies ZAP files location for the application.
    By default, the option points to the :file:`src/default_zap` directory and can be changed to any path relative to application's location that contains the ZAP file and :file:`zap-generated` directory.
  * Experimental support for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board.
  * Optional smart plug device functionality.
  * Experimental support for the Thread protocol.
  * The :ref:`multiprotocol_bt_thread` page.

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

* Added the functions :c:func:`bt_hci_err_to_str` and :c:func:`bt_security_err_to_str` that are used to allow printing error codes as strings.
  Each function returns string representations of the error codes when the corresponding Kconfig option, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_HCI_ERR_TO_STR` or :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SECURITY_ERR_TO_STR`, is enabled.
* Updated the :ref:`nrf53_audio_app_overview` documentation page with the :ref:`nrf53_audio_app_overview_files` section.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Added:

  * A debug configuration enabling the `Fast Pair`_ feature on the nRF54L15 PDK with the ``nrf54l15pdk/nrf54l15/cpuapp`` board target.
  * An application versioning using the :file:`VERSION` file.
    The versioning is only applied to the application configurations that use the MCUboot bootloader.
  * The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_USB_HID_REPORT_SENT_ON_SOF <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option to :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state`.
    The option allows to synchronize providing HID data with USB Start of Frame (SOF).
    The feature reduces the negative impact of jitter related to USB polls, but it also increases HID data latency.
    For details, see :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state_sof_synchronization`.
  * Local HID report buffering in :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb_state`.
    This ensures that the memory buffer passed to the USB next stack is valid until a HID report is sent and allows to enqueue up to two HID input reports for a USB HID instance (used only when :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_USB_HID_REPORT_SENT_ON_SOF <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option is enabled).
  * Bootup logs with the manifest semantic version information to :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu_mcumgr` when the module is used for SUIT DFU and the SDFW supports semantic versioning (requires v0.6.2 and higher).
  * Manifest semantic version information to the firmware information response in :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu` when the module is used for SUIT DFU and the SDFW supports semantic versioning (requires v0.6.2 and higher).
  * A missing DTS node compatible with ``zephyr,hid-device`` to the nRF52840 DK in the MCUboot QSPI configuration.
    This ensures support for HID over USB when the USB next stack is selected.
  * The USB next stack (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_USB_STACK_NEXT <config_desktop_app_options>`) implies partial erase feature of the nRF SoC flash driver (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_PARTIAL_ERASE`).
    This is done to improve stability of the USB next stack.
    The partial erase feature works around device errors that might be reported by Windows USB host in Device Manager if USB cable is connected while erasing secondary image slot in the background.
  * Bluetooth connectivity support (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BT <config_desktop_app_options>`) implies using a separate workqueue for connection TX notify processing (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CONN_TX_NOTIFY_WQ`) if MPSL is used for synchronization between the flash memory driver and radio (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_RADIO_SYNC_MPSL`).
    This is done to work around the timeout in MPSL flash synchronization (``NCSDK-29354`` known issue).
    See :ref:`known_issues` for details.

* Updated:

  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_TX_POWER_CORRECTION_VAL` Kconfig option value in configurations with the Fast Pair support.
    The value is now aligned with the Fast Pair requirements.
  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_RRAM_WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE` Kconfig option value in the nRF54L15 PDK configurations to ensure short write slots.
    It prevents timeouts in the MPSL flash synchronization caused by allocating long write slots while maintaining a Bluetooth LE connection with short intervals and no connection latency.
  * The method of obtaining hardware ID using Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:hwinfo_api` on the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20`.
    Replaced the custom implementation of the :c:func:`z_impl_hwinfo_get_device_id` function in the nRF Desktop application with the native Zephyr driver function that now supports the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20` board target.
    Removed the ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_HWINFO_BLE_ADDRESS_FICR_POSTFIX`` Kconfig option as a postfix constant is no longer needed for the Zephyr native driver.
    The driver uses ``BLE.ADDR``, ``BLE.IR``, and ``BLE.ER`` fields of the Factory Information Configuration Registers (FICR) to provide 8 bytes of unique hardware ID.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu_mcumgr` to recognize the MCUmgr custom group ID (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MGMT_GROUP_ID_SUIT`) from the SUITFU subsystem (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MGMT_SUITFU`) as a DFU-related command group.
  * All build configurations with the DFU over MCUmgr support to require encryption for operations on the Bluetooth GATT SMP service (see the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_BT_PERM_RW_ENCRYPT` Kconfig option).
    The Bluetooth pairing procedure of the unpaired Bluetooth peers must now be performed before the DFU operation.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_dfu_mcumgr` to enable the MCUmgr handler that is used to report the bootloader information (see the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_OS_BOOTLOADER_INFO` Kconfig option).
  * The MCUboot image configurations for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54l15dk_nrf54l15` board to enable Link Time Optimization (LTO) (see the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTO` Kconfig option) and reduce the memory footprint of the bootloader.
  * The partition memory configurations for the :ref:`zephyr:nrf54l15dk_nrf54l15` board to optimize the size of the MCUboot bootloader partition.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_constlat` to use the :c:func:`nrfx_power_constlat_mode_request` and :c:func:`nrfx_power_constlat_mode_free` functions instead of :c:func:`nrf_power_task_trigger` to control requesting Constant Latency sub-power mode.
    This ensures correct behavior if another source requests Constant Latency sub-power mode through the nrfx API.
  * The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_CONSTLAT_DISABLE_ON_STANDBY <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option depends on :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_PM_EVENTS`.
    CAF Power Management events support is necessary to disable constant latency interrupts on standby.

* Removed support for the nRF54L15 PDK revision v0.2.x.

----------------

* Added:

  * DTLS support for the ``#XUDPSVR`` and ``#XSSOCKET`` (UDP server sockets) AT commands when the :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` configuration file is used.
  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SLM_PPP_FALLBACK_MTU` Kconfig option that is used to control the MTU used by PPP when the cellular link MTU is not returned by the modem in response to the ``AT+CGCONTRDP=0`` AT command.
  * Handler for new nRF Cloud event type ``NRF_CLOUD_EVT_RX_DATA_DISCON``.
  * Support for socket option ``AT_SO_IPV6_DELAYED_ADDR_REFRESH``.

  * AT string parsing to utilize the :ref:`at_parser_readme` library instead of the :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library.
  * The ``#XUDPCLI`` and ``#XSSOCKET`` (UDP client sockets) AT commands to use Zephyr's Mbed TLS with DTLS when the :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` configuration file is used.

* Removed:

  * Support for the :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` configuration file with the ``thingy91/nrf9160/ns`` board target.
  * Support for deprecated RAI socket options ``AT_SO_RAI_LAST``, ``AT_SO_RAI_NO_DATA``, ``AT_SO_RAI_ONE_RESP``, ``AT_SO_RAI_ONGOING``, and ``AT_SO_RAI_WAIT_MORE``.
  * The ``#XCARRIERCFG="bootstrap_smartcard"`` AT command.

Thingy:53: Matter weather station
---------------------------------

* Added the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NCS_SAMPLE_MATTER_ZAP_FILES_PATH` Kconfig option, which specifies ZAP files location for the application.
  By default, the option points to the :file:`src/default_zap` directory and can be changed to any path relative to application's location that contains the ZAP file and :file:`zap-generated` directory.

Binary libraries
----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Bluetooth libraries and services
--------------------------------

* :ref:`bt_fast_pair_readme` library:

  * Added:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_BN` Kconfig option that enables support for the Battery Notification extension.
      You must enable this option to access Fast Pair API elements associated with the Battery Notification extension.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_SUBSEQUENT_PAIRING` Kconfig option allowing the user to control the support for the Fast Pair subsequent pairing feature.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_USE_CASE` Kconfig choice option allowing the user to select their target Fast Pair use case.
      The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_USE_CASE_UNKNOWN`, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_USE_CASE_INPUT_DEVICE`, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_USE_CASE_LOCATOR_TAG` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_USE_CASE_MOUSE` Kconfig options represent the supported use cases that can be selected as part of this Kconfig choice option.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_BOND_MANAGER` Kconfig option that enables the Fast Pair bond management functionality.
      If this option is enabled, the Fast Pair subsystem tracks the Bluetooth bonds created through the Fast Pair Procedure and unpairs them if the procedure is incomplete or the Account Key associated with the bonds is removed.
      It also unpairs the Fast Pair Bluetooth bonds on Fast Pair factory reset.
      The option is enabled by default for Fast Pair use cases that are selected using :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_USE_CASE_INPUT_DEVICE` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_USE_CASE_MOUSE` Kconfig options.

  * Updated the default values of the following Fast Pair Kconfig options:

    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_SUBSEQUENT_PAIRING`
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_REQ_PAIRING`
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_PN`
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_GATT_SERVICE_MODEL_ID`

    These Kconfig options are now disabled by default and are selected only by the Fast Pair use cases that require them.

  * Removed:

    * The Mbed TLS cryptographic backend support in Fast Pair, because it is superseded by the PSA backend.
      Consequently, the ``CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_CRYPTO_MBEDTLS`` Kconfig option has also been removed.
    * The default overrides for the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_DIS` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_DIS_FW_REV` Kconfig options that enable these options together with the Google Fast Pair Service.
      This configuration is now selected only by the Fast Pair use cases that require the Device Information Service (DIS).
    * The default override for the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_DIS_FW_REV_STR` Kconfig option that was set to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_IMGTOOL_SIGN_VERSION` if :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT` was enabled.
      The default override is now handled in the Kconfig of the Zephyr Device Information Service (DIS) module and is based on Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:app-version-details` that uses the :file:`VERSION` file.
    * The :c:func:`bt_fast_pair_factory_reset_user_action_prepare` weak function definition, which could previously be overridden to prepare for the incoming Fast Pair factory reset.
      You can still override the :c:func:`bt_fast_pair_factory_reset_user_action_perform` weak function to perform custom actions during the Fast Pair factory reset.

* :ref:`bt_le_adv_prov_readme`:

  * Added the :c:member:`bt_le_adv_prov_adv_state.adv_handle` field to the :c:struct:`bt_le_adv_prov_adv_state` structure to store the advertising handle.
    If the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_EXT_ADV` Kconfig option is enabled, you can use the :c:func:`bt_hci_get_adv_handle` function to obtain the advertising handle for the advertising set that employs :ref:`bt_le_adv_prov_readme`.
    If the Kconfig option is disabled, the :c:member:`bt_le_adv_prov_adv_state.adv_handle` field must be set to ``0``.
    This field is currently used by the TX Power provider (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_TX_POWER`).
  * Updated the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_FAST_PAIR_SHOW_UI_PAIRING` Kconfig option and the :c:func:`bt_le_adv_prov_fast_pair_show_ui_pairing` function to require the enabling of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_SUBSEQUENT_PAIRING` Kconfig option.

Common Application Framework

Modem libraries
---------------

* Added:

   * The :ref:`at_parser_readme` library.
     The :ref:`at_parser_readme` is a library that parses AT command responses, notifications, and events.
     Compared to the deprecated :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library, it does not allocate memory dynamically and has a smaller footprint.
     For more information on how to transition from the :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library to the :ref:`at_parser_readme` library, see the :ref:`migration guide <migration_2.8_recommended>`.
   * The :ref:`lib_uicc_lwm2m` library.
     This library reads the LwM2M bootstrap configuration from SIM.

    * The :c:enumerator:`LTE_LC_EVT_RAI_UPDATE` event that is enabled with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_RAI_REQ` Kconfig option.
      This requires the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_LC_RAI_MODULE` Kconfig option to be enabled.

  * Updated:

    * To use the :ref:`at_parser_readme` library instead of the :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library.
    * The :c:func:`lte_lc_neighbor_cell_measurement` function to return an error for invalid GCI count.
    * The library was reorganized into modules that are enabled through their respective Kconfig options.
      By default, the library now enables only the core features related to the network connectivity.
      This reorganization reduces flash memory consumption for applications that only use the core features of the library related to network connectivity.
      For more information on how to update your project, see the :ref:`migration guide <migration_2.8_required>`.

      * The :c:func:`lte_lc_conn_eval_params_get` function now requires the new :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_LC_CONN_EVAL_MODULE` Kconfig option to be enabled.

      Refer to the :ref:`migration guide <migration_2.8>` for more details.

  * Removed:

    * The ``lte_lc_init`` function.
      All instances of this function can be removed without any additional actions.
    * The ``lte_lc_deinit`` function.
      Use the :c:func:`lte_lc_power_off` function instead.
    * The ``lte_lc_init_and_connect`` function.
      Use the :c:func:`lte_lc_connect` function instead.
    * The ``lte_lc_init_and_connect_async`` function.
      Use the :c:func:`lte_lc_connect_async` function instead.
    * The ``CONFIG_LTE_NETWORK_USE_FALLBACK`` Kconfig option.

      In addition, you can control the priority between LTE-M and NB-IoT using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_MODE_PREFERENCE` Kconfig option.

* :ref:`lib_location` library:

  * Fixed:

    * A bug causing the GNSS obstructed visibility detection to sometimes count only part of the tracked satellites.
    * A bug causing the GNSS obstructed visibility detection to be sometimes performed twice.

  * Removed the unused :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library.

* :ref:`lib_zzhc`:

  * Updated to use the :ref:`at_parser_readme` library instead of the :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library.

* :ref:`modem_info_readme` library:

  * Updated:

    * To use the :ref:`at_parser_readme` library instead of the :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library.
    * The formulas of RSRP and RSRQ values in :c:macro:`RSRP_IDX_TO_DBM` and :c:macro:`RSRQ_IDX_TO_DB` based on AT command reference guide updates.
      The formulas are now aligned with the modem implementation that has not changed
      but the AT command reference guide has not been up to date with the modem implementation.

  * Removed ``RSRP_OFFSET_VAL``, ``RSRQ_OFFSET_VAL`` and ``RSRQ_SCALE_VAL`` from the API.
    Clients should have used the :c:macro:`RSRP_IDX_TO_DBM` and the :c:macro:`RSRQ_IDX_TO_DB` macros.

  * Updated:

    * The RTT trace backend to allocate the RTT channel at boot, instead of when the modem is activated.
    * The flash trace backend to solve concurrency issues when reading traces while writing, and when reinitializing the application (warm start).
    * Renamed the nRF91 socket offload layer from ``nrf91_sockets`` to ``nrf9x_sockets`` to reflect that the offload layer is not exclusive to the nRF91 Series SiPs.
    * The :ref:`modem_trace_module` to let the trace thread sleep when the modem trace level is set to :c:enumerator:`NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE_LEVEL_OFF` using the :c:func:`nrf_modem_lib_trace_level_set` function, and the trace backend returns ``-ENOSPC``.
      The trace thread wakes up when another trace level is set.
    * The RTT trace backend to return ``-ENOSPC`` when the RTT buffer is full.
      This allows the trace thread to sleep to save power.
    * The nRF91 socket offload layer is renamed from ``nrf91_sockets`` to ``nrf9x_sockets`` to reflect that the offload layer is not exclusive to the nRF91 Series SiPs.

  * Removed:

    * Support for deprecated RAI socket options ``SO_RAI_LAST``, ``SO_RAI_NO_DATA``, ``SO_RAI_ONE_RESP``, ``SO_RAI_ONGOING``, and ``SO_RAI_WAIT_MORE``.
    * The mutex in the :c:func:`nrf9x_socket_offload_getaddrinfo` function after updating the :c:func:`nrf_getaddrinfo` function to handle concurrent requests.

* :ref:`modem_info_readme` library:

  * Fixed a potential issue with scanf in the :c:func:`modem_info_get_current_band` function, which could lead to memory corruption.

* :ref:`modem_key_mgmt` library:

  * Added the :c:func:`modem_key_mgmt_clear` function to delete all credentials associated with a security tag.

* :ref:`pdn_readme` library:

  * Added the event ``PDN_EVENT_CTX_DESTROYED`` to indicate when a PDP context is destroyed.
    This happens when the modem is switched to minimum functionality mode (``CFUN=0``).

* :ref:`sms_readme` library:

  * Added the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SMS_STATUS_REPORT` Kconfig option to configure whether the SMS status report is requested.

  * Updated:

    * To use the ``AT+CMMS`` AT command when sending concatenated SMS message.
    * To set "7" as a fallback SMS service center address for type approval SIM cards which do not have it set.

* :ref:`lib_at_shell` library:

  * Added the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_AT_SHELL_UNESCAPE_LF` Kconfig option to enable reception of multiline AT commands.
  * Updated the :c:func:`at_shell` function to replace ``\n`` with ``<CR><LF>`` if :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_AT_SHELL_UNESCAPE_LF` is enabled.

* :ref:`modem_key_mgmt` library:

  * Updated the :c:func:`modem_key_mgmt_read()` function to return the actual size buffer required to read the certificate if the size provided is too small.

Multiprotocol Service Layer libraries
-------------------------------------

* Added a 1-wire coexistence implementation that you can enable using the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MPSL_CX_1WIRE`.
* Updated the name of the Kconfig option ``CONFIG_MPSL_CX_THREAD`` to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MPSL_CX_3WIRE` to better indicate multiprotocol compatibility.
* Fixed an issue where the HFXO would be left on after uninitializing MPSL when the RC oscillator was used as the Low Frequency clock source (DRGN-22809).
* Deprecated the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MPSL_CX_BT_1WIRE`.

Libraries for networking
------------------------

* :ref:`lib_lwm2m_client_utils` library:

  * Updated to use the :ref:`at_parser_readme` library instead of the :ref:`at_cmd_parser_readme` library.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_rest` library:

  * Added the function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_rest_shadow_transform_request` to request shadow data using a JSONata expression.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:

  * Added:

    * The function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_client_id_runtime_set` to set the device ID string if the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_CLIENT_ID_SRC_RUNTIME` Kconfig option is enabled.
    * The functions :c:func:`nrf_cloud_sec_tag_set` and :c:func:`nrf_cloud_sec_tag_get` to set and get the sec tag used for nRF Cloud credentials.
    * A new nRF Cloud event type ``NRF_CLOUD_EVT_RX_DATA_DISCON`` which is generated when a device is deleted from nRF Cloud.
    * The functions :c:func:`nrf_cloud_print_details` and :c:func:`nrf_cloud_print_cloud_details` to log common nRF Cloud connection information in a uniform way.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_PRINT_DETAILS` Kconfig option to enable the above functions.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_VERBOSE_DETAILS` Kconfig option to print all details instead of only the device ID.
    * Experimental support for shadow transform requests over MQTT using the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_shadow_transform_request` function.
      This functionality is enabled by the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_MQTT_SHADOW_TRANSFORMS` Kconfig option.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_COMBINED_CA_CERT_SIZE_THRESHOLD` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_COAP_CA_CERT_SIZE_THRESHOLD` Kconfig options to compare with the current root CA certificate size.
    * The functions :c:func:`nrf_cloud_sec_tag_coap_jwt_set` and :c:func:`nrf_cloud_sec_tag_coap_jwt_get` to set and get the sec tag used for nRF Cloud CoAP JWT signing.

  * Updated:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_CLIENT_ID_SRC_RUNTIME` Kconfig option to be available with CoAP and REST.
    * The JSON string representing longitude in ``PVT`` reports from ``lng`` to ``lon`` to align with nRF Cloud.
      nRF Cloud still accepts ``lng`` for backward compatibility.
    * The handling of MQTT JITP device association to improve speed and reliability.
    * To use nRF Cloud's custom MQTT topics instead of the default AWS topics.
    * MQTT and CoAP transports to use a single unified DNS lookup mechanism that supports IPv4 and IPv6, fallback to IPv4, and handling of multiple addresses returned by :c:func:`getaddrinfo`.
    * The log module in the :file:`nrf_cloud_fota_common.c` file from ``NRF_CLOUD`` to ``NRF_CLOUD_FOTA``.
    * The :c:func:`nrf_cloud_credentials_configured_check` function to retrieve the size of the root CA, and compare it to thresholds to decide whether the CoAP, AWS, or both root CA certs are present.
      Use this information to log helpful information and decide whether the root CA certificates are compatible with the configured connection type.

  * Fixed:

    * An issue in the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_send` function that prevented data in the provided :c:struct:`nrf_cloud_obj` structure from being sent to the bulk and bin topics.
    * An issue where the modem was not shut down from bootloader mode before attempting to initialize in normal mode after an unsuccessful update.

  * Deprecated:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_IPV6` Kconfig option, which now no longer forces the nRF Cloud MQTT transport to use IPv4 when not enabled.
      Instead, use the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NET_IPV4` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NET_IPV6` Kconfig options to customize which IP versions the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library uses.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_STATIC_IPV4` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_STATIC_IPV4_ADDR` Kconfig options.
      Support for statically configured nRF Cloud IP Addresses will soon be removed.
      Leave :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_STATIC_IPV4` disabled to instead use automatic DNS lookup.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_coap` library:

  * Added:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_COAP_DISCONNECT_ON_FAILED_REQUEST` Kconfig option to disconnect the CoAP client on a failed request.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_COAP_JWT_SEC_TAG` Kconfig option to allow for a separate sec tag to be used for nRF Cloud CoAP JWT signing.

  * Updated:

    * To use a shorter resource string for the ``d2c/bulk`` resource.
    * The function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_coap_shadow_get` to return ``-E2BIG`` if the received shadow data was truncated because the provided buffer was not big enough.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_COAP_DOWNLOADS` Kconfig option to be enabled by default if either the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_FOTA_POLL` or :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_PGPS` Kconfig option is enabled.

  * Fixed:

    * A hard fault that occurred when encoding AGNSS request data and the ``net_info`` field of the :c:struct:`nrf_cloud_rest_agnss_request` structure is NULL.
    * An issue where certain CoAP functions could return zero, indicating success, even though there was an error.

  * Removed the experimental status (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL`) from the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_COAP_DOWNLOADS` Kconfig option.

* :ref:`lib_lwm2m_client_utils` library:

  * Fixed an issue where a failed delta update for the modem would not clear the state and blocks future delta updates.
    This only occurred when an LwM2M Firmware object was used in push mode.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_log` library:

  * Added:

    * Support for dictionary logs using REST.
    * Support for dictionary (binary) logs when connected to nRF Cloud using CoAP.

  * Updated to use INF log level when the cloud side changes the log level.

  * Fixed the missing log source when passing a direct log call to the nRF Cloud logging backend.
    This caused the log parser to incorrectly use the first declared log source with direct logs when using dictionary mode.

* :ref:`lib_fota_download` library:

  * Fixed an issue where the download client instance did not use native TLS although the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FOTA_DOWNLOAD_NATIVE_TLS` Kconfig option was enabled.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_fota` library:

  * Added:

    * FOTA status callback.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_FOTA_SMP` Kconfig option to enable experimental support for SMP FOTA.

  * Updated:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_FOTA_DOWNLOAD_FRAGMENT_SIZE` Kconfig option to be available and used also when the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_FOTA_POLL` Kconfig option is enabled.
      The range of the option is now from 128 to 1900 bytes, and the default value is 1700 bytes.
    * The function :c:func:`nrf_cloud_fota_poll_process` to be used asynchronously if a callback to handle errors is provided.

* :ref:`lib_mqtt_helper` library:

  * Updated the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MQTT_HELPER_PROVISION_CERTIFICATES` Kconfig option to depend on :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TLS_CREDENTIALS` instead of specific boards.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_provisioning` library:

  * Added support for the ``SO_KEEPOPEN`` socket option to keep the socket open even during PDN disconnect and reconnect.
  * Updated the check interval logging to use INF to improve customer experience.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_alert` library:

  * Updated to use INF log level when cloud side changes the alert enable flag.

-----------------

* Added an experimental serialization of NFC tag 2 and tag 4 APIs.
* Fixed a potential issue with handling data pointers in the function ``ring_buf_get_data`` in the :file:`platform_internal_thread` file.

nRF RPC libraries
-----------------

* Added:

  * An experimental serialization of Openthread APIs.
  * The logging backend that sends logs through nRF RPC events.

Other libraries
---------------

* Added the :ref:`nrf_compression` library with support for the LZMA decompression.

* :ref:`lib_date_time` library:

  * Added:

    * A retry feature that reattempts failed date-time updates up to a certain number of consecutive times.
    * The Kconfig options :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DATE_TIME_RETRY_COUNT` to control whether and how many consecutive date-time update retries may be performed, and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DATE_TIME_RETRY_INTERVAL_SECONDS` to control how quickly date-time update retries occur.

  * Fixed a bug that caused date-time updates to not be rescheduled under certain circumstances.

* :ref:`lib_ram_pwrdn` library:

  * Added support for the nRF54L15 SoC.

Security libraries
------------------

* :ref:`nrf_security_readme` library:

  * Added the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_WANT_ALG_SP800_108_COUNTER_CMAC` Kconfig option to key derivation function configurations in :ref:`nrf_security_driver_config`.
    The Kconfig option enables support for the derivation function SP 800-108r1 CMAC in counter mode, which is supported by the nrf_cracen driver.

* :ref:`trusted_storage_readme` library:

  * Added support for Zephyr Memory Storage (ZMS), as an alternative to the NVS file system.

Documentation
=============

* Added:

  * The :ref:`ug_app_dev` section, which includes pages from the :ref:`configuration_and_build` section and from the removed Device configuration guides section.
  * The :ref:`dfu_tools_mcumgr_cli` page after it was removed from the Zephyr repository.
  * The :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_suit_soc_binaries` page.
  * The :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_suit_push` page documenting the SUIT push model-based update process.
  * The :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_suit_recovery` page.
  * The :ref:`nrf_rpc_uart` page.
  * The :ref:`ug_bt_stack_arch` and the :ref:`ug_bt_solution` documentation to the :ref:`Bluetooth protocols <ug_bt>` page.

* Updated:

  * The :ref:`ug_nrf70_developing_debugging` page with the new snippets added for the nRF70 driver debug and WPA supplicant debug logs.
  * The :ref:`programming_params` section on the :ref:`programming` page with information about readback protection moved from the :ref:`ug_nrf5340_building` page.
  * The :ref:`security` page with a table that provides an overview of the available general security features.
    This table replaces the subpage that was previously describing these features in more detail and was duplicating information available in other sections.
  * Restructured the :ref:`app_bootloaders` documentation and combined the DFU and bootloader articles.
    Additionally, created a new bootloader :ref:`bootloader_quick_start`.
  * Separated the instructions about building from :ref:`configure_application` and moved it to a standalone :ref:`building` page.
  * Restructured the :ref:`ug_bt_mesh` documentation for clearer distinction between concepts or overview topics and how-to topics, thus moved some information from the Bluetooth Mesh library sections.
  * The :ref:`nrf_security_drivers_cracen` section with a reference to the :ref:`ug_nrf54l_cryptography` page.
  * The :ref:`ug_tfm` page with the correct list of samples demonstrating TF-M.
  * The :ref:`app_approtect_ncs` section on the :ref:`app_approtect` page with details on setting the Kconfig options and register values to enable AP-Protect.

* Removed:

  * The Device configuration guides section and moved its contents to :ref:`ug_app_dev`.
  * The Advanced building procedures page and moved its contents to the :ref:`building` page.
  * nRF70 Series support is upstreamed to Zephyr, hence the documentation is removed from the |NCS|.
  * The standalone pages for getting started with nRF52 Series and with the nRF5340 DK.
    These pages have been replaced by the `Quick Start`_ app, which now supports the nRF52 Series devices and the nRF5340 DK.
