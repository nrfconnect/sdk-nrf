  * Updated:

    * The use of neighbor cell measurements for cellular positioning.
      Previously, 1-2 searches were performed and now 1-3 will be done depending on the requested number of cells and the number of found cells.
      Also, only GCI cells are counted towards the requested number of cells, and normal neighbors are ignored from this perspective.
    * Cellular positioning not to use GCI search when the device is in RRC connected mode, because the modem cannot search for GCI cells in that mode.

* :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library:

  * Added:

    * The :c:func:`lte_lc_psm_param_set_seconds` function and Kconfig options :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_PSM_REQ_FORMAT`, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_PSM_REQ_RPTAU_SECONDS`, and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_PSM_REQ_RAT_SECONDS` to enable setting of PSM parameters in seconds instead of using bit field strings.

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_NETWORK_USE_FALLBACK` Kconfig option is deprecated.
      Use the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_NETWORK_MODE_LTE_M_NBIOT` or :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_NETWORK_MODE_LTE_M_NBIOT_GPS` Kconfig option instead.
      In addition, you can control the priority between LTE-M and NB-IoT using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_MODE_PREFERENCE` Kconfig option.
    * The :c:func:`lte_lc_init` function is deprecated.
    * The :c:func:`lte_lc_deinit` function is deprecated.

    * The :c:func:`lte_lc_init_and_connect` function is deprecated.
      Use the :c:func:`lte_lc_connect` function instead.
    * The :c:func:`lte_lc_init_and_connect_async` function is deprecated.
      Use the :c:func:`lte_lc_connect_async` function instead.

  * Removed the deprecated Kconfig option ``CONFIG_LTE_AUTO_INIT_AND_CONNECT``.

* :ref:`nrf_modem_lib_readme`:

  * Added:

    * A mention about enabling TF-M logging while using modem traces in the :ref:`modem_trace_module`.

  * Updated by renaming ``lte_connectivity`` module to ``lte_net_if``.
    All related Kconfig options have been renamed accordingly.
  * Changed the default value of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_NET_IF_AUTO_START`, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_NET_IF_AUTO_CONNECT`, and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_NET_IF_AUTO_DOWN` Kconfig options from enabled to disabled.

  * Removed:

    * The deprecated Kconfig option ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_SYS_INIT``.
    * The deprecated Kconfig option ``CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_IPC_IRQ_PRIO_OVERRIDE``.
    * The ``NRF_MODEM_LIB_NET_IF_DOWN`` flag support in the ``lte_net_if`` network interface driver.

* :ref:`lib_modem_slm`:

    * Changed the GPIO used to be configurable using devicetree.
