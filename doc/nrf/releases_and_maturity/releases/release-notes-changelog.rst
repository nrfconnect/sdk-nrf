* The minimal TF-M build profile no longer silences TF-M logs by default.

  .. note::
     This can be a breaking change if the UART instance used by TF-M is already in use, for example by modem trace with a UART backend.

Documentation
=============

* Added

  * A page on :ref:`ug_nrf70_developing_debugging` in the :ref:`ug_nrf70_developing` user guide.
  * A page on :ref:`ug_nrf70_developing_fw_patch_ext_flash` in the :ref:`ug_nrf70_developing` user guide.
  * A page on :ref:`ug_nrf70_developing_raw_ieee_80211_packet_transmission` in the :ref:`ug_nrf70_developing` user guide.
  * :ref:`contributions_ncs` page in a new :ref:`contributions` section that also includes the development model pages, previously listed under :ref:`releases_and_maturity`.

* Updated:

  * The :ref:`installation` section by replacing two separate pages about installing the |NCS| with just one (:ref:`install_ncs`).
  * The :ref:`requirements` page with new sections about :ref:`requirements_clt` and :ref:`toolchain_management_tools`.
  * The :ref:`configuration_and_build` section:

    * :ref:`app_build_system` gathers conceptual information about the build and configuration system previously listed on several other pages.
    * New reference page :ref:`app_build_output_files` gathers information previously listed on several other pages.
    * :ref:`app_dfu` and :ref:`app_bootloaders` are now separate sections, with the DFU section summarizing the available DFU methods in a table.

  * The :ref:`ug_nrf9160_gs` and :ref:`ug_thingy91_gsg` pages so that instructions in the :ref:`nrf9160_gs_connecting_dk_to_cloud` and :ref:`thingy91_connect_to_cloud` sections, respectively, match the updated nRF Cloud workflow.
  * The :ref:`ug_nrf9160_gs` by replacing the Updating the DK firmware section with a new :ref:`nrf9160_gs_installing_software` section.
    This new section includes steps for using Quick Start, a new application in `nRF Connect for Desktop`_ that streamlines the getting started process with the nRF91 Series DKs.
  * The :ref:`tfm_enable_share_uart` section on :ref:`ug_nrf9160`.
  * Integration steps in the :ref:`ug_bt_fast_pair` guide.
    Reorganized extension-specific content into dedicated subsections.
  * The :ref:`ug_nrf70_developing_powersave_power_save_mode` section in the :ref:`ug_nrf70_developing_powersave` user guide.
  * The :ref:`nrf7002dk_nrf5340` page with a link to the `Wi-Fi Fundamentals course`_ in the `Nordic Developer Academy`_.
