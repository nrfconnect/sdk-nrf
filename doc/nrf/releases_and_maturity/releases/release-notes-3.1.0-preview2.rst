Applications
============

|no_changes_yet_note|

Connectivity bridge
-------------------

* Fixed to resume Bluetooth connectable advertising after a disconnect.


IPC radio firmware
------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Matter bridge
-------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

* Added:

  * Experimental support for Audio on the nRF5340 DK, with LED state indications and button controls.

* Updated:

  * The application to use the ``NFC.TAGHEADER0`` value from FICR as the broadcast ID instead of using a random ID.
  * The application to change from Newlib to Picolib to align with |NCS| and Zephyr.
  * The application to use the :ref:`net_buf_interface` API to pass audio data between threads.
    The :ref:`net_buf_interface` will also contain the metadata about the audio stream in the ``user_data`` section of the API.
    This change was done to transition to standard Zephyr APIs, as well as to have a structured way to pass N-channel audio between modules.
  * The optional buildprog tool to use `nRF Util`_ instead of nrfjprog that has been deprecated.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Updated:

  * The application configurations for dongles on memory-limited SoCs (such as nRF52820) to reuse the system workqueue for GATT Discovery Manager (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_GATT_DM_WORKQ_SYS`).
    This helps to reduce RAM usage.
  * Link Time Optimization (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTO`) to be enabled in MCUboot configurations of the nRF52840 DK (``mcuboot_smp``, ``mcuboot_qspi``).
    LTO no longer causes boot failures and it reduces the memory footprint.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_hids` to use shared callbacks for multiple HID reports:

    * Use the :c:func:`bt_hids_inp_rep_send_userdata` function to send HID input reports while in report mode.
    * Use an extended callback with the notification event to handle subscriptions for HID input reports in report mode (:c:struct:`bt_hids_inp_rep`).
    * Use generic callbacks to handle HID feature and output reports.

    This approach simplifies the process of adding support for new HID reports.

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Serial LTE modem
----------------

* Updated:

  * The ``AT#XPPP`` command to support the CID parameter to specify the PDN connection used for PPP.
  * The ``#XPPP`` notification to include the CID of the PDN connection used for PPP.
  * The initialization of the application to ignore a failure in nRF Cloud module initialization.
    This occurs sometimes especially during development.
  * The initialization of the application to send "INIT ERROR" over to UART and show clear error log to indicate that the application is not operational in case of failing initialization.
  * The PPP downlink data to trigger the indicate pin when SLM is in idle.
  * The ``AT#XTCPCLI`` and the ``AT#XUDPCLI`` commands to support CID of the PDN connection.

Thingy:53: Matter weather station
---------------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Samples
=======

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`sample <samples>`.

Amazon Sidewalk samples
-----------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Bluetooth samples
-----------------

* :ref:`bluetooth_isochronous_time_synchronization` sample:

  * Fixed an issue where the sample would assert with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ASSERT` Kconfig option enabled.
    This was due to calling the :c:func:`bt_iso_chan_send` function from a timer ISR handler and sending SDUs to the controller with invalid timestamps.

|no_changes_yet_note|

Bluetooth Mesh samples
----------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Bluetooth Fast Pair samples
---------------------------

* :ref:`fast_pair_locator_tag` sample:

  * Added possibility to build and run the sample without the motion detector support (with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_FMDN_DULT_MOTION_DETECTOR` Kconfig option disabled).
  * Updated the :ref:`fast_pair_locator_tag_testing_fw_update_notifications` section to improve the test procedure.
    The application provides now an additional log message to indicate that the firmware version is being read.

Cellular samples
----------------

* Deprecated the :ref:`lte_sensor_gateway` sample.
  It is no longer maintained.

* :ref:`nrf_cloud_multi_service` sample:

  * Added support for native simulator platform and updated the documentation accordingly.

Libraries
=========

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`library <libraries>`.

Binary libraries
----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Bluetooth libraries and services
--------------------------------

* :ref:`bt_fast_pair_readme` library:

  * Updated the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_FMDN_RING_REQ_TIMEOUT_DULT_MOTION_DETECTOR` Kconfig option dependency.
    The dependency has been updated from the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_FMDN_DULT` Kconfig option to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_FMDN_DULT_MOTION_DETECTOR`.

Common Application Framework
----------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Debug libraries
---------------

* Added an experimental :ref:`Zephyr Core Dump <zephyr:coredump>` backend that writes a core dump to an internal flash or RRAM partition.
  To enable this backend, set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DEBUG_COREDUMP_BACKEND_OTHER` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DEBUG_COREDUMP_BACKEND_NRF_FLASH_PARTITION` Kconfig options.

* :ref:`cpu_load` library:

  * Added prefix ``NRF_`` to all Kconfig options (for example, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CPU_LOAD`) to avoid conflicts with Zephyr Kconfig options with the same names.

DFU libraries
-------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Gazell libraries
----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Security libraries
------------------

* :ref:`nrf_security` library:

  * Updated:

    * The name of the Kconfig option ``CONFIG_PSA_USE_CRACEN_ASYMMETRIC_DRIVER`` to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_USE_CRACEN_ASYMMETRIC_ENCRYPTION_DRIVER`, which is more descriptive and more consistent with the options of the other drivers.
    * The placement of the page about nRF Security drivers.
      The page was moved to :ref:`ug_crypto_index` and renamed to :ref:`crypto_drivers`.


Modem libraries
---------------

* :ref:`at_parser_readme` library:

  * Added support for parsing DECT NR+ modem firmware names.

  * Updated the following macros and functions to return ``-ENODATA`` when the target subparameter to parse is empty:

    * :c:macro:`at_parser_num_get` macro
    * Functions:

      * :c:func:`at_parser_int16_get`
      * :c:func:`at_parser_uint16_get`
      * :c:func:`at_parser_int32_get`
      * :c:func:`at_parser_uint32_get`
      * :c:func:`at_parser_int64_get`
      * :c:func:`at_parser_uint64_get`
      * :c:func:`at_parser_string_get`

* :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library:

  * Added the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_LC_DNS_FALLBACK_MODULE` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_LC_DNS_FALLBACK_ADDRESS` Kconfig options to enable setting a fallback DNS address.
    The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_LC_DNS_FALLBACK_MODULE` Kconfig option is enabled by default.
    If the application has configured a DNS server address in Zephyr's native networking stack, using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DNS_SERVER1` Kconfig option, the same server is set as the fallback address for DNS queries offloaded to the nRF91 Series modem.
    Otherwise, the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_LC_DNS_FALLBACK_ADDRESS` Kconfig option controls the fallback DNS server address that is set to Cloudflare's DNS server: 1.1.1.1 by default.
    The device might or might not receive a DNS address by the network during PDN connection.
    Even within the same network, the PDN connection establishment method (PCO vs ePCO) might change when the device operates in NB-IoT or LTE Cat-M1, resulting in missing DNS addresses when one method is used, but not the other.
    Having a fallback DNS address ensures that the device always has a DNS to fallback to.

* :ref:`lib_modem_slm` library:

  * Added:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MODEM_SLM_UART_RX_BUF_COUNT` Kconfig option for configuring RX buffer count.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MODEM_SLM_UART_RX_BUF_SIZE` Kconfig option for configuring RX buffer size.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MODEM_SLM_UART_TX_BUF_SIZE` Kconfig option for configuring TX buffer size.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MODEM_SLM_AT_CMD_RESP_MAX_SIZE` Kconfig option for buffering AT command responses.

  * Updated the UART implementation between the host device, using the :ref:`lib_modem_slm` library, and the device running the :ref:`Serial LTE Modem <slm_description>` application.

  * Removed:

    * The ``CONFIG_MODEM_SLM_DMA_MAXLEN`` Kconfig option.
      Use :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MODEM_SLM_UART_RX_BUF_SIZE` instead.
    * The ``modem_slm_reset_uart()`` function, as there is no longer a need to reset the UART.

Multiprotocol Service Layer libraries
-------------------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Libraries for networking
------------------------

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:

  * Updated:

    * To return negative :file:`errno.h` errors instead of positive ZCBOR errors.
    * The CoAP download authentication to no longer depend on the :ref:`CoAP Client library <zephyr:coap_client_interface>`.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_provisioning` library:

  * Fixed an issue where the results from the :c:func:`zsock_getaddrinfo` function were not freed when the CoAP protocol was used for connection establishment.

Libraries for NFC
-----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

nRF RPC libraries
-----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Other libraries
---------------

* :ref:`dult_readme` library:

  * Updated the write handler of the accessory non-owner service (ANOS) GATT characteristic to no longer assert on write operations if the DULT was not enabled at least once.

Shell libraries
---------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

sdk-nrfxlib
-----------

See the changelog for each library in the :doc:`nrfxlib documentation <nrfxlib:README>` for additional information.

Scripts
=======

* Added the :file:`ncs_ironside_se_update.py` script in the :file:`scripts/west_commands` folder.
  The script adds the west command ``west ncs-ironside-se-update`` for installing an IronSide SE update.

* :ref:`nrf_desktop_config_channel_script` Python script:

  * Updated:

    * The udev rules for Debian, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint HID host computers (replaced the :file:`99-hid.rules` file with :file:`60-hid.rules`).
      This is done to ensure that the rules are properly applied for an nRF Desktop device connected directly over Bluetooth LE.
      The new udev rules are applied to any HID device that uses the Nordic Semiconductor Vendor ID (regardless of Product ID).
    * The HID device discovery to ensure that a discovery failure of a HID device would not affect other HID devices.
      Without this change, problems with discovery of a HID device could lead to skipping discovery and listing of other HID devices (even if the devices work properly).
