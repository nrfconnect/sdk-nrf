|NCS| delivers reference software and supporting libraries for developing low-power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor products in the nRF52, nRF53, nRF70, and nRF91 Series.
The SDK includes open source projects (TF-M, MCUboot, OpenThread, Matter, and the Zephyr RTOS), which are continuously integrated and redistributed with the SDK.

Release notes might refer to "experimental" support for features, which indicates that the feature is incomplete in functionality or verification, and can be expected to change in future releases.
To learn more, see :ref:`software_maturity`.

Changelog
*********

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

Protocols
=========

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`protocol <protocols>`.

Matter
------

* Updated:

  * The default Message Reliability Protocol (MRP) retry intervals for Thread devices to two seconds to reduce the number of spurious retransmissions in Thread networks.
  * Increased the number of available packet buffers in the Matter stack to avoid packet allocation issues.

Wi-Fi
-----

* Added:

  * Build-time disconnection timeout configuration.
  * BSSID as a parameter for the Wi-Fi ``connect`` command.
  * Auto-security mode with a fresh key management type to enhance connection time.
  * The following fixes and improvements:

    * Wi-Fi stuck in an awake state.
    * Frequent Wi-Fi disconnections in a congested environment and low RSSI.
    * HTTPS upload and download performance issues.
    * MQTT disconnection in a congested environment and low RSSI.
    * Selecting the best RSSI access point.
    * Rate adaptation enhancements to improve range in the 2.4 GHz band.
    * Radio test - Error in setting ``reg_domain``.

 To accommodate all fixes and improvements, there is a 1 kB increase in the stack usage of the WPA supplicant.
 Users must increase the stack sizes appropriately in their applications.

Thread
------

* Fixed ``otPlatCryptoPbkdf2GenerateKey`` API implementation to allow a fallback to legacy Mbed TLS implementation instead of returning ``OT_ERROR_NOT_CAPABLE``.

Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

Matter Bridge
-------------

* Added:

  * The :ref:`CONFIG_BRIDGE_BT_MAX_SCANNED_DEVICES <CONFIG_BRIDGE_BT_MAX_SCANNED_DEVICES>` Kconfig option to set the maximum number of scanned Bluetooth LE devices.
  * The :ref:`CONFIG_BRIDGE_BT_SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS <CONFIG_BRIDGE_BT_SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS>` Kconfig option to set the scan timeout.

* Fixed an issue where the recovery mechanism for Bluetooth LE connections might not work correctly.

Samples
=======

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`sample <samples>`.

Wi-Fi samples
-------------

* :ref:`wifi_shell_sample` sample:

  * Modified ``connect`` command to provide better control over connection parameters.
  * Added ``Auto-Security-Personal`` mode to the ``connect`` command.

Zephyr
======

The Zephyr fork in |NCS| (``sdk-zephyr``) contains all commits from the upstream Zephyr repository up to and including ``23cf38934c0f68861e403b22bc3dd0ce6efbfa39``.
It also contains some |NCS| specific additions and commits cherry-picked from the upstream Zephyr repository, including the following one:

* Fixed the GPIO configuration that is used in the ``pinctrl`` driver for the QSPI IO3 line.
  Due to these incorrect settings, the QSPI NOR flash driver could not initialize successfully for a flash chip configured to work in non-Quad (2 I/O) mode.

For a complete list of |NCS| specific commits and cherry-picked commits since v2.6.0, run the following command:

.. code-block:: none
