|no_changes_yet_note|

Matter bridge
-------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

nRF5340 Audio
-------------

* Added:

  * Experimental support for Audio on the nRF5340 DK, with LED state indications and button controls.

* Updated:

  * The application to use the ``NFC.TAGHEADER0`` value from FICR as the broadcast ID instead of using a random ID.
  * The application to change from Newlib to Picolib to align with |NCS| and Zephyr.
  * The application to use the :ref:`net_buf_interface` API to pass audio data between threads.
    The :ref:`net_buf_interface` will also contain the metadata about the audio stream in the ``user_data`` section of the API.
    This change was done to transition to standard Zephyr APIs, as well as to have a structured way to pass N-channel audio between modules.
  * The optional buildprog tool to use `nRF Util`_ instead of nrfjprog that has been deprecated.
  * The documentation pages with information about the :ref:`SD card playback module <nrf53_audio_app_overview_architecture_sd_card_playback>` and :ref:`how to enable it <nrf53_audio_app_configuration_sd_card_playback>`.

* Removed:

  * The uart_terminal tool to use standardized tools.
    Similar functionality is provided through the `nRF Terminal <nRF Terminal documentation_>`_ in the |nRFVSC|.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Added:

  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_eventq`.
    The utility can be used by an application module to temporarily queue HID events related to keypresses (button press or release) to handle them later.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_keymap`.
    The utility can be used by an application module to map an application-specific key ID to a HID report ID and HID usage ID pair according to statically defined user configuration.
    The :file:`hid_keymap.h` file was moved from the :file:`configuration/common` directory to the :file:`src/util` directory.
    The file is now the header of the :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_keymap` and contains APIs exposed by the utility.

* Updated:

  * The application configurations for dongles on memory-limited SoCs (such as nRF52820) to reuse the system workqueue for GATT Discovery Manager (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_GATT_DM_WORKQ_SYS`).
    This helps to reduce RAM usage.
  * Link Time Optimization (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTO`) to be enabled in MCUboot configurations of the nRF52840 DK (``mcuboot_smp``, ``mcuboot_qspi``).
    LTO no longer causes boot failures and it reduces the memory footprint.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_hids` to use shared callbacks for multiple HID reports:

    * Use the :c:func:`bt_hids_inp_rep_send_userdata` function to send HID input reports while in report mode.
    * Use an extended callback with the notification event to handle subscriptions for HID input reports in report mode (:c:struct:`bt_hids_inp_rep`).
    * Use generic callbacks to handle HID feature and output reports.

    This approach simplifies the process of adding support for new HID reports.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_state` to:

    * Use the :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_eventq` to temporarily queue HID events related to keypresses before a connection to the HID host is established.
    * Use the :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_keymap` to map an application-specific key ID from :c:struct:`button_event` to a HID report ID and HID usage ID pair.

    The features were implemented directly in the HID state module before.
    This change simplifies the HID state module implementation and allows code reuse.
  * The HID input and output report maps (``input_reports`` and ``output_reports`` arrays defined in the :file:`configuration/common/hid_report_desc.h` file) to contain only IDs of enabled HID reports.
  * The default value of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_APP_EVENT_MANAGER_MAX_EVENT_CNT` Kconfig option to ``64``.
    This ensures that more complex configurations fit in the limit.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_reportq` to accept HID report IDs that do not belong to HID input reports supported by the application (are not part of the ``input_reports`` array defined in :file:`configuration/common/hid_report_desc.h` file).
    Before the change, providing an unsupported HID report ID caused an assertion failure.
    Function signatures of the :c:func:`hid_reportq_subscribe` and :c:func:`hid_reportq_unsubscribe` functions were slightly changed (both functions return an error in case the provided HID report ID is unsupported).

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Serial LTE modem
----------------

* Added:

  * The ``AT#XAPOLL`` command to asynchronously poll sockets for data.
  * The send flags for ``#XSEND``, ``#XSENDTO``, ``#XTCPSEND`` and ``#XUDPSEND`` commands.
  * The send flag value ``512`` for waiting for acknowledgment of the sent data.

* Updated:

  * The ``AT#XPPP`` command to support the CID parameter to specify the PDN connection used for PPP.
  * The ``#XPPP`` notification to include the CID of the PDN connection used for PPP.
  * The initialization of the application to ignore a failure in nRF Cloud module initialization.
    This occurs sometimes especially during development.
  * The initialization of the application to send "INIT ERROR" over to UART and show clear error log to indicate that the application is not operational in case of failing initialization.
  * The PPP downlink data to trigger the indicate pin when SLM is in idle.
  * The ``AT#XTCPCLI`` and the ``AT#XUDPCLI`` commands to support CID of the PDN connection.

|no_changes_yet_note|

Libraries
=========

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`library <libraries>`.

Binary libraries
----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Bluetooth libraries and services
--------------------------------

* :ref:`bt_fast_pair_readme` library:

  * Updated the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_FMDN_RING_REQ_TIMEOUT_DULT_MOTION_DETECTOR` Kconfig option dependency.
    The dependency has been updated from the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_FMDN_DULT` Kconfig option to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_FMDN_DULT_MOTION_DETECTOR`.

Common Application Framework
----------------------------

* :ref:`caf_ble_state`:

  * Removed the tracking of the active Bluetooth connections.
    CAF no longer assumes that the Bluetooth Peripheral device (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_PERIPHERAL`) supports only one simultaneous connection (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MAX_CONN`).

Debug libraries
---------------

* Added an experimental :ref:`Zephyr Core Dump <zephyr:coredump>` backend that writes a core dump to an internal flash or RRAM partition.
  To enable this backend, set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DEBUG_COREDUMP_BACKEND_OTHER` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DEBUG_COREDUMP_BACKEND_NRF_FLASH_PARTITION` Kconfig options.

* :ref:`cpu_load` library:

  * Added prefix ``NRF_`` to all Kconfig options (for example, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CPU_LOAD`) to avoid conflicts with Zephyr Kconfig options with the same names.

DFU libraries
-------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Gazell libraries
----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Security libraries
------------------

* :ref:`nrf_security` library:

  * Updated:

    * The name of the Kconfig option ``CONFIG_PSA_USE_CRACEN_ASYMMETRIC_DRIVER`` to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_USE_CRACEN_ASYMMETRIC_ENCRYPTION_DRIVER`, which is more descriptive and more consistent with the options of the other drivers.
    * The placement of the page about nRF Security drivers.
      The page was moved to :ref:`ug_crypto_index` and renamed to :ref:`crypto_drivers`.


Modem libraries
---------------

* :ref:`nrf_modem_lib_readme`:

  * Fixed an issue with modem fault handling in the :ref:`nrf_modem_lib_lte_net_if`, where the event must be deferred from interrupt context before it can be forwarded to the Zephyr's :ref:`net_mgmt_interface` module.

* :ref:`at_parser_readme` library:

  * Added support for parsing DECT NR+ modem firmware names.

  * Updated the following macros and functions to return ``-ENODATA`` when the target subparameter to parse is empty:

    * :c:macro:`at_parser_num_get` macro
    * Functions:

      * :c:func:`at_parser_int16_get`
      * :c:func:`at_parser_uint16_get`
      * :c:func:`at_parser_int32_get`
      * :c:func:`at_parser_uint32_get`
      * :c:func:`at_parser_int64_get`
      * :c:func:`at_parser_uint64_get`
      * :c:func:`at_parser_string_get`

* :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library:

  * Added the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_LC_DNS_FALLBACK_MODULE` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_LC_DNS_FALLBACK_ADDRESS` Kconfig options to enable setting a fallback DNS address.
    The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_LC_DNS_FALLBACK_MODULE` Kconfig option is enabled by default.
    If the application has configured a DNS server address in Zephyr's native networking stack, using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DNS_SERVER1` Kconfig option, the same server is set as the fallback address for DNS queries offloaded to the nRF91 Series modem.
    Otherwise, the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_LC_DNS_FALLBACK_ADDRESS` Kconfig option controls the fallback DNS server address that is set to Cloudflare's DNS server: 1.1.1.1 by default.
    The device might or might not receive a DNS address by the network during PDN connection.
    Even within the same network, the PDN connection establishment method (PCO vs ePCO) might change when the device operates in NB-IoT or LTE Cat-M1, resulting in missing DNS addresses when one method is used, but not the other.
    Having a fallback DNS address ensures that the device always has a DNS to fallback to.

* :ref:`lib_modem_slm` library:

  * Added:

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MODEM_SLM_UART_RX_BUF_COUNT` Kconfig option for configuring RX buffer count.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MODEM_SLM_UART_RX_BUF_SIZE` Kconfig option for configuring RX buffer size.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MODEM_SLM_UART_TX_BUF_SIZE` Kconfig option for configuring TX buffer size.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MODEM_SLM_AT_CMD_RESP_MAX_SIZE` Kconfig option for buffering AT command responses.

  * Updated:

      * The software maturity of the library to supported instead of experimental.
      * The UART implementation between the host device, using the :ref:`lib_modem_slm` library, and the device running the :ref:`Serial LTE Modem <slm_description>` application.

  * Removed:

    * The ``CONFIG_MODEM_SLM_DMA_MAXLEN`` Kconfig option.
      Use :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MODEM_SLM_UART_RX_BUF_SIZE` instead.
    * The ``modem_slm_reset_uart()`` function, as there is no longer a need to reset the UART.

* :ref:`modem_info_readme` library:

  * Added:

    * The :c:func:`modem_info_get_rsrq` function for requesting the RSRQ.
    * The :c:macro:`SNR_IDX_TO_DB` macro for converting the SNR index to dB.

Multiprotocol Service Layer libraries
-------------------------------------

* Added an implementation of the API required by the MPSL (defined by :file:`mpsl_hwres.h`) for the nRF53 and nRF54L Series devices.

* Updated the implementation of the following interrupt service routine wrappers:

  * :c:func:`mpsl_timer0_isr_wrapper`
  * :c:func:`mpsl_rtc0_isr_wrapper`
  * :c:func:`mpsl_radio_isr_wrapper`

  Now, they do not trigger the kernel scheduler or use any kernel APIs.

  .. note::

     Invoking kernel APIs or triggering the kernel scheduler from Zero Latency Interrupts is considered undefined behavior.
     Users of MPSL timeslots should not assume that thread rescheduling will occur automatically at the end of a timeslot.

Libraries for networking
------------------------

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library:

  * Updated:

    * To return negative :file:`errno.h` errors instead of positive ZCBOR errors.
    * The CoAP download authentication to no longer depend on the :ref:`CoAP Client library <zephyr:coap_client_interface>`.

* :ref:`lib_nrf_provisioning` library:

  * Added

    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_PROVISIONING_INITIAL_BACKOFF` Kconfig option to configure the initial backoff time for provisioning retries.
    * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_PROVISIONING_STACK_SIZE` Kconfig option to configure the stack size of the provisioning thread.
    * A new query parameter to limit the number of provisioning commands included in a single provisioning request.
      This limit can be configured using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_PROVISIONING_CBOR_RECORDS` Kconfig option.

  * Updated:

    * Limited key-value pairs in a single provisioning command to ``10``.
      This is done to reduce the RAM usage of the library.

  * Fixed an issue where the results from the :c:func:`zsock_getaddrinfo` function were not freed when the CoAP protocol was used for connection establishment.

* :ref:`lib_downloader` library:

  * Fixed:

    * A bug in the shell implementation causing endless download retries on errors.
    * A bug in the shell to allow multiple downloads.

Libraries for NFC
-----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

nRF RPC libraries
-----------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

Other libraries
---------------

* :ref:`dult_readme` library:

  * Updated the write handler of the accessory non-owner service (ANOS) GATT characteristic to no longer assert on write operations if the DULT was not enabled at least once.

Shell libraries
---------------

|no_changes_yet_note|

sdk-nrfxlib
-----------

See the changelog for each library in the :doc:`nrfxlib documentation <nrfxlib:README>` for additional information.

Scripts
=======

* Added the :file:`ncs_ironside_se_update.py` script in the :file:`scripts/west_commands` folder.
  The script adds the west command ``west ncs-ironside-se-update`` for installing an IronSide SE update.

* :ref:`nrf_desktop_config_channel_script` Python script:

  * Updated:

    * The udev rules for Debian, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint HID host computers (replaced the :file:`99-hid.rules` file with :file:`60-hid.rules`).
      This is done to ensure that the rules are properly applied for an nRF Desktop device connected directly over Bluetooth LE.
      The new udev rules are applied to any HID device that uses the Nordic Semiconductor Vendor ID (regardless of Product ID).
    * The HID device discovery to ensure that a discovery failure of a HID device would not affect other HID devices.
      Without this change, problems with discovery of a HID device could lead to skipping discovery and listing of other HID devices (even if the devices work properly).
