The |NCS| follows a development model that gives users access to both stable releases and new features that are still under development.

The |NCS| is an SDK that is openly developed and maintained by Nordic Semiconductor.
It is based both on code developed by Nordic Semiconductor engineers and on open-source software projects, which in turn are developed collaboratively by many contributors.

Users can continuously track the development progress of the |NCS| and even contribute to it.
This includes both the Nordic-specific and the open-source portions of the SDK.

Any individual or company can choose to contribute to the |NCS| codebase.
Contributions are welcome but entirely optional, as the licenses used by the |NCS| allow for free modification of the source code without a requirement to contribute the changes back.
