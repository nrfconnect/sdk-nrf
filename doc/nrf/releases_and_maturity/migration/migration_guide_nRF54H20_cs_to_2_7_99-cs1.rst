Migration notes for |NCS| v2.7.99-cs1 and the nRF54H20 DK
#########################################################

This document describes what existing users of the |NCS| v2.7.0 must consider when migrating their environment to the |NCS| v2.7.99-cs1:

nRF54H20 DK compatibility
  The |NCS| v2.7.99-cs1 is compatible only with the nRF54H20 DK, version PCA10175 v0.8.0 (ES4) or later revisions.

|NCS| v2.7.99-cs1
  You can update your |NCS| v2.7.0 installation and toolchain to v2.7.99-cs1 by using the Toolchain Manager:

  1. Open `nRF Connect for Desktop`_.
  #. Open the Toolchain Manager application in nRF Connect for Desktop.
  #. Click the button with the arrow pointing down next to the installed |NCS| version (v2.7.0) to expand the drop-down menu with options.
  #. In the drop-down menu, click :guilabel:`Update toolchain`.
  #. In the same drop-down menu, click :guilabel:`Update SDK`.

nrfutil device
  ``nrfutil device`` has been updated to version 2.4.6.

  Install the nRF Util ``device`` command version 2.4.6 as follows::

     nrfutil install device=2.4.6 --force

  For more information, consult the `nRF Util`_ documentation.

nRF54H20 BICR
  The nRF54H20 BICR has been updated.

  To update the BICR of your development kit while in Root of Trust, do the following:

  1. Download the `BICR new binary file`_.
  #. Connect the nRF54H20 DK to your computer using the **DEBUGGER** port on the DK.

     .. note::
        On MacOS, connecting the DK might cause a popup containing the message ``Disk Not Ejected Properly`` to repeatedly appear on screen.
        To disable this, run ``JLinkExe``, then run ``MSDDisable`` in the J-Link Commander interface.

  #. List all the connected development kits to see their serial number (matching the one on the DK's sticker)::

        nrfutil device list

  #. Move the BICR HEX file to a folder of your choice, then program the BICR by running nRF Util from that folder using the following command::

        nrfutil device program --options chip_erase_mode=ERASE_NONE --firmware <path_to_bicr.hex> --core Application --serial-number <serialnumber>

SDFW and SCFW firmwares
  The *nRF54H20 SoC binaries* have been updated to version 0.6.2.

  .. caution::
     Before proceeding with the SoC binaries update, you must first update the BICR as described in the previous chapter.

  To update the SoC binaries of your development kit while in Root of Trust, do the following:

  1. Download the `nRF54H20 SoC binaries v0.6.2`_.

     .. note::
        On MacOS, ensure that the ZIP file is not unpacked automatically upon download.

  #. Move the bundle's :file:`.zip` archive to a folder of your choice, unzip the archive, and then run nRF Util to program the :file:`nordic_top.suit` using the following command::

        nrfutil device x-suit-dfu --firmware nordic_top.suit --serial-number <serialnumber>
