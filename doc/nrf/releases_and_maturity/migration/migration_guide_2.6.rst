Migration guide for |NCS| v2.6.0 (Working draft)
################################################

This document describes the changes required or recommended when migrating your application from |NCS| v2.5.0 to |NCS| v2.6.0.

Required changes
****************

The following changes are mandatory to make your application work in the same way as in previous releases.

* For the Serial LTE Modem (SLM) application:

  * The Zephyr settings backend has been changed from :ref:`FCB <fcb_api>` to :ref:`NVS <nvs_api>`.
    Because of this, one setting is restored to its default value after the switch if you are using the :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library.
    The setting controls whether the SLM connects automatically to the network on startup.
    You can read and write it using the ``AT#XCARRIER="auto_connect"`` command.

* For the Matter samples and applications using Intermittently Connected Devices configuration (formerly called Sleepy End Devices):

  * The naming convention for the energy-optimized devices has been changed from Sleepy End Devices (SED) to Intermittently Connected Devices (ICD).
    Because of this, the Kconfig options used to manage this configuration have been aligned as well.
    If your application uses the following Kconfig options, they require name changes:

      * The ``CONFIG_CHIP_ENABLE_SLEEPY_END_DEVICE_SUPPORT`` Kconfig option was renamed to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ENABLE_ICD_SUPPORT`.
      * The ``CONFIG_CHIP_SED_IDLE_INTERVAL`` Kconfig option was renamed to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ICD_SLOW_POLL_INTERVAL`.
      * The ``CONFIG_CHIP_SED_ACTIVE_INTERVAL`` Kconfig option was renamed to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ICD_FAST_POLLING_INTERVAL`.
      * The ``CONFIG_CHIP_SED_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD`` Kconfig option was renamed to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ICD_ACTIVE_MODE_THRESHOLD`.

* For samples using Wi-Fi features:

  * A few Kconfig options related to scan operations have been removed in the current release. If your application uses them,
    they will need to be updated to remove the dependency on these:

      * ``CONFIG_WIFI_MGMT_SCAN_BANDS``
      * ``CONFIG_WIFI_MGMT_SCAN_DWELL_TIME_ACTIVE``
      * ``CONFIG_WIFI_MGMT_SCAN_DWELL_TIME_PASSIVE``
      * ``CONFIG_WIFI_MGMT_SCAN_SSID_FILT``
      * ``CONFIG_WIFI_MGMT_SCAN_MAX_BSS_CNT``
      * ``CONFIG_WIFI_MGMT_SCAN_CHAN``
