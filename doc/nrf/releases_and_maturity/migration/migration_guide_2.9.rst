Matter
------

.. toggle::

   * For the Matter samples and applications:

      * The :ref:`ug_matter_device_watchdog` mode has been changed.
        Previously, the :ref:`ug_matter_device_watchdog_pause_mode` was enabled by default for all Matter samples.
        Now, this mode is disabled and all Matter watchdog sources must be fed within the specified time window.

        To re-enable the pause mode, set the :ref:`CONFIG_NCS_SAMPLE_MATTER_WATCHDOG_PAUSE_IN_SLEEP<CONFIG_NCS_SAMPLE_MATTER_WATCHDOG_PAUSE_IN_SLEEP>` Kconfig option to ``y``.
