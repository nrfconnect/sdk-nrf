Required changes
****************

The following changes are mandatory to make your application work in the same way as in previous releases.

Samples and applications
========================

This section describes the changes related to samples and applications.

Matter
------

.. toggle::

   * For the Matter samples and applications:

      * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NCS_SAMPLE_MATTER_ZAP_FILE_PATH` Kconfig option has been introduced.
        Previously, the path to the ZAP file was deduced based on hardcoded locations.
        Now, the location is configured using :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NCS_SAMPLE_MATTER_ZAP_FILE_PATH` Kconfig option.
        This change requires you to update your application ``prj.conf`` file by setting :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NCS_SAMPLE_MATTER_ZAP_FILE_PATH` to point the location of you ZAP file.

nRF5340 Audio applications
--------------------------

.. toggle::

   * The :ref:`nrf53_audio_app` has been updated to use the :ref:`net_buf_interface` API to handle audio data.
     This change requires you to update your application code to use the new APIs for audio data handling.
     See :ref:`ncs_release_notes_changelog` for more information.

nRF Desktop
-----------

.. toggle::

   * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_state` has been updated to use the :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_keymap` to map an application-specific key ID to a HID report ID and HID usage ID pair.
     The ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_HID_STATE_HID_KEYMAP_DEF_PATH`` Kconfig option has been removed and needs to be replaced with the :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_HID_KEYMAP_DEF_PATH <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option.
     The format of the configuration file remains the same.

Libraries
=========

This section describes the changes related to libraries.

* :ref:`nrf_security_readme` library:

  * The ``CONFIG_PSA_USE_CRACEN_ASYMMETRIC_DRIVER`` Kconfig option has been replaced by :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_USE_CRACEN_ASYMMETRIC_ENCRYPTION_DRIVER`.

* :ref:`supl_client` library:

  * The SUPL client OS integration library dependency on the newlib C library has been removed.
    To use SUPL with picolibc, v0.8.0 or later of the nRF91 Series SUPL client library is required.

.. _migration_3.1_recommended:

Build system
============

.. toggle::

   * In sysbuild, the following CMake extensions have been removed:

     * ``sysbuild_dt_nodelabel``
     * ``sysbuild_dt_alias``
     * ``sysbuild_dt_node_exists``
     * ``sysbuild_dt_node_has_status``
     * ``sysbuild_dt_prop``
     * ``sysbuild_dt_comp_path``
     * ``sysbuild_dt_num_regs``
     * ``sysbuild_dt_reg_addr``
     * ``sysbuild_dt_reg_size``
     * ``sysbuild_dt_has_chosen``
     * ``sysbuild_dt_chosen``

     You must now use pre-existing devicetree extensions, such as ``dt_nodelabel``, without the ``sysbuild_`` prefix.
     To specify the sysbuild image, use the ``TARGET`` argument in place of ``IMAGE``.

     The following example shows one of the removed functions:

     .. code-block:: none

        sysbuild_dt_chosen(
          flash_node
          IMAGE ${DEFAULT_IMAGE}
          PROPERTY "zephyr,flash"
        )

     It should now be modified as follows:

     .. code-block:: none

        dt_chosen(
          flash_node
          TARGET ${DEFAULT_IMAGE}
          PROPERTY "zephyr,flash"
        )
