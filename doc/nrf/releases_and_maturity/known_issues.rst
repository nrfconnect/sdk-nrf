Amazon Sidewalk
===============

.. rst-class:: v2-6-0

KRKNWK-18465: BUS fault on FSK during the FACTORY_RESET call
  The Bluetooth LE link is deinitialized.
  However, a race condition might occur where an event added by the *BluetoothÂ®* LE link is not removed.
  Acting on the event without a valid Bluetooth LE handle leads to dereference of ``NULL``.
  To avoid the error, you need to check for ``NULL`` before the event is processed in the event queue.
  The issue requires a fix in the Sidewalk stack.

  **Workaround:** Perform a factory reset as the error is recoverable.

.. rst-class:: v2-6-0

KRKNWK-18511: Advertising fails to start (``err -12``) upon registration
  The Sidewalk end device is trying to restart advertising, for example, on time sync lost.
  This happens even when the device is connected through Bluetooth LE, leading to an error.
  The Bluetooth LE connection management requires a fix in the Sidewalk stack.

  **Workaround:** The issue fixes upon automatic restart of the Bluetooth LE advertising.

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0

KRKNWK-17860: QSPI assert occurs when performing DFU in the Sidewalk application mode
  The DFU must be performed only in the DFU mode.
  The DFU Bluetooth service can be used in the Sidewalk mode, however, using it leads to assertion failure, resulting in a Zephyr fatal error.

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0

KRKNWK-17800: After reconnecting to the network, the end device cannot find the route to its host
  After the device disconnects from Sidewalk servers, the sensor monitoring app over Bluetooth LE shows an error ``-38 (SID_ERROR_NO_ROUTE_AVAILABLE)``.

  **Workaround:** The device needs to be reset manually.

.. rst-class:: v2-6-0 v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0

KRKNWK-17750: Error occurs when sending multiple messages in a short period of time
  When sending multiple Sidewalk messages in a short period of time, the internal queues might become full, showing misleading error messages, such as ``-12 (SID_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_PARAMS)``.

  **Workaround:** The message must be resent after the protocol empties the queues.

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0

KRKNWK-17244: CMake warnings when building the Sidewalk samples
  CMake warnings (``No SOURCES given to Zephyr library``) show up in the build log of a Sidewalk application.
  The application builds successfully, but the error might obfuscate other important warnings.

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0

KRKNWK-17374: Sporadic Zephyr fatal error after disconnecting on FSK
  After disconnecting on FSK, Zephyr fatal error occurs due to assertion in the semaphore module.
  The error reproduces rarely (once per a few days).
  The device resets automatically in the release mode, however, in the debug mode it needs to be reset manually.
  Currently, this issue occurs for Sidewalk v1.14 libraries, and it will be fixed in a future version.

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0

KRKNWK-17035: Sensor monitor uplink messages are lost when the notification period is longer than 30 seconds
  If the notification period is set to longer than 30 seconds, sensor monitor uplink messages are lost.

  **Workaround:** The notification period is set to 15 seconds by default.

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0

KRKNWK-14583: Bus fault after flash, before the :file:`Nordic_MFG.hex` data flash
  For sub-GHz samples, when the :file:`Nordic_MFG.hex` file is missing, the device throws a hard fault during initializing the Sidewalk stack.
  Proper error handling will be implemented, but the temporary solution is to write a manufacturing hexadecimal code to the device and reset it.

.. rst-class:: v2-6-0 v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0

KRKNWK-14299: NRPA MAC address cannot be set in Zephyr
  The non-resolvable private address (NRPA) cannot be set in the connectable mode for Bluetooth LE.
  Currently, there is no workaround for this issue.

Bluetooth LE
============

The issues in this section are related to :ref:`ug_ble_controller`.

.. _ncsdk_19865:

.. rst-class:: v2-3-0 v2-2-0 v2-1-4 v2-1-3 v2-1-2 v2-1-1 v2-1-0 v2-0-2 v2-0-1 v2-0-0 v1-9-2 v1-9-1 v1-9-0 v1-8-0 v1-7-1 v1-7-0 v1-6-1 v1-6-0 v1-5-2 v1-5-1 v1-5-0 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0 v1-2-1 v1-2-0 v1-1-0 v1-0-0 v0-4-0 v0-3-0

NCSDK-19865: GATT Robust Caching issues for bonded peers
  The Client Supported Features value written by a bonded peer may not be stored in the non-volatile memory.
  Change awareness of the bonded peer is lost on reboot.
  After reboot, each bonded peer is initially marked as change-unaware.

  **Workaround:** Disable the GATT Caching feature (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_GATT_CACHING`).
  Make sure that Bluetooth bonds are removed together with disabling GATT Caching if the functionality is disabled during a firmware upgrade.

.. rst-class:: v2-0-2

DRGN-17695: The BT RX thread stack might overflow if the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SMP` is enabled
  When performing SMP pairing MPU FAULTs might be triggered because the stack is not large enough.

  **Workaround:** Increase the stack size manually in the project configuration file (:file:`prj.conf`) using :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_RX_STACK_SIZE`.

.. rst-class:: v1-8-0 v1-7-1 v1-7-0 v1-6-1 v1-6-0 v1-5-2 v1-5-1 v1-5-0 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0 v1-2-1 v1-2-0 v1-1-0 v1-0-0

NCSDK-13459: Uninitialized size in hids_boot_kb_outp_report_read
  When reading from the boot keyboard output report characteristic, the :ref:`hids_readme` calls the registered callback with uninitialized report size.

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply commit with fix from main (commit hash: ``f18250dad6cbd9778de7af4b8a774b58e55fe720``).

.. rst-class:: v1-5-2 v1-5-1 v1-5-0 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0 v1-2-1 v1-2-0 v1-1-0 v1-0-0

NCSDK-9106: Bluetooth ECC thread stack size too small
  The Bluetooth ECC thread used during the pairing procedure with LE Secure Connections might overflow when an interrupt is triggered when the stack usage is at its maximum.

  **Workaround:** Increase the ECC stack size by setting ``CONFIG_BT_HCI_ECC_STACK_SIZE`` to ``1140``.

.. rst-class:: v1-5-0 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0

DRGN-15435: GATT notifications and Writes Without Response might be sent out of order
  GATT notifications and Writes Without Response might be sent out of order when not using a complete callback.

  **Workaround:** Always set a callback for notifications and Writes Without Response.

.. rst-class:: v1-5-0 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0 v1-2-1 v1-2-0 v1-1-0 v1-0-0

DRGN-15448: Incomplete bond overwrite during pairing procedure when peer is not using the IRK stored in the bond
  When pairing with a peer that has deleted its bond information and is using a new IRK to establish the connection, the existing bond is not overwritten during the pairing procedure.
  This can lead to MIC errors during reconnection if the old LTK is used instead.

.. rst-class:: v1-5-2 v1-5-1 v1-5-0 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0 v1-2-1 v1-2-0 v1-1-0 v1-0-0

NCSDK-8224: Callbacks for "security changed" and "pairing failed" are not always called
  The pairing failed and security changed callbacks are not called when the connection is disconnected during the pairing procedure or the required security is not met.

  **Workaround:** Application should use the disconnected callback to handle pairing failed.

.. rst-class:: v1-5-2 v1-5-1 v1-5-0 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0 v1-2-1 v1-2-0 v1-1-0 v1-0-0

NCSDK-8223: GATT requests might deadlock RX thread
  GATT requests might deadlock the RX thread when all TX buffers are taken by GATT requests and the RX thread tries to allocate a TX buffer for a response.
  This causes a deadlock because only the RX thread releases the TX buffers for the GATT requests.
  The deadlock is resolved by a 30 second timeout, but the ATT bearer cannot transmit without reconnecting.

  **Workaround:** Set :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_L2CAP_TX_BUF_COUNT` >= ``CONFIG_BT_ATT_TX_MAX`` + 2.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0 v1-2-1 v1-2-0 v1-1-0 v1-0-0

NCSDK-6845: Pairing failure with simultaneous pairing on multiple connections
  When using LE Secure Connections pairing, the pairing fails with simultaneous pairing on multiple connections.
  The failure reason is unspecified.

  **Workaround:** Retry the pairing on the connections that failed one by one after the pairing procedure has finished.

.. rst-class:: v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

NCSDK-6844: Security procedure failure can terminate GATT client request
  A security procedure terminates the GATT client request that is currently in progress, unless the request was the reason to initiate the security procedure.
  If a new GATT client request is queued at this time, this might potentially cause a GATT transaction violation and fail as well.

  **Workaround:** Do not initiate a security procedure in parallel with GATT client requests.

.. rst-class:: v1-3-0

NCSDK-5711: High-throughput transmission can deadlock the receive thread
  High-throughput transmission can deadlock the receive thread if the connection is suddenly disconnected.

.. rst-class:: v1-2-1 v1-2-0

Only secure applications can use Bluetooth LE
  Bluetooth LE cannot be used in a non-secure application, for example, an application built for the ``nrf5340_dk_nrf5340_cpuappns`` build target.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF5340

  **Workaround:** Use the ``nrf5340_dk_nrf5340_cpuapp`` build target instead.

.. rst-class:: v1-2-1 v1-2-0 v1-1-0

:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SMP` alignment requirement
  When running the :ref:`bluetooth_central_dfu_smp` sample, the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SMP` configuration must be aligned between this sample and the Zephyr counterpart (:zephyr:code-sample:`smp-svr`).
  However, security is not enabled by default in the Zephyr sample.

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2

DRGN-21390: The `disconnected` callback might not get called on nRF5340
  The Bluetooth host running on the nRF5340 application core might deadlock on disconnection.
  This is due to a recent bugfix in the SoftDevice Controller triggering a bug in the ATT queuing layer.

  **Workaround:** Either disable host flow control (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_HCI_ACL_FLOW_CONTROL`) or cherry-pick commits from the upstream: `Zephyr PR #65272 <https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/65272>`_.

Bluetooth Mesh
==============

The issues in this section are related to the :ref:`ug_bt_mesh` protocol.

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0 v2-4-3 v2-4-2 v2-4-1 v2-4-0 v2-3-0 v2-2-0 v2-1-4 v2-1-3 v2-1-2 v2-1-1 v2-1-0 v2-0-2 v2-0-1 v2-0-0 v1-9-2 v1-9-1 v1-9-0 v1-8-0 v1-7-1

NCSDK-21625: Advertisements of Bluetooth Mesh GATT services are not stopped by :c:func:`bt_mesh_suspend` and not resumed by :c:func:`bt_mesh_resume`
  Functions :c:func:`bt_mesh_suspend` and :c:func:`bt_mesh_resume` do not work together with functions :c:func:`bt_disable` and :c:func:`bt_enable`.

  **Workaround:** To disable node identity advertisement, use ``bt_mesh_subnet_node_id_set`` instead.

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0 v2-4-3 v2-4-2 v2-4-1 v2-4-0 v2-3-0 v2-2-0 v2-1-4 v2-1-3 v2-1-2 v2-1-1 v2-1-0 v2-0-2 v2-0-1 v2-0-0 v1-9-2 v1-9-1 v1-9-0 v1-8-0 v1-7-1

NCSDK-23087: Unsolicited Time Status messages rewrite periodic publishing TTL to zero forever
  The Time models specification mandates publishing unsolicited Time Status messages with TTL field value set to ``0``.
  The implementation rewrites the TTL field to ``0``, but does not write the initial value back, resulting in losing the initial value.

  **Workaround:** Configure the initial TTL value after an unsolicited Time Status message is sent.

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0 v2-4-3 v2-4-2 v2-4-1 v2-4-0 v2-3-0 v2-2-0 v2-1-4 v2-1-3 v2-1-2 v2-1-1 v2-1-0 v2-0-2 v2-0-1 v2-0-0 v1-9-2 v1-9-1 v1-9-0 v1-8-0 v1-7-1

NCSDK-23220: The Heartbeat Publication Status message may be malformed after provisioning
  After provisioning and obtaining the Composition Data, reading the Heartbeat Publication and the Heartbeat Publication Status will contain garbage in the NetKeyIndex field.
  The reason for this is that the field was not initially cleared.

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0

NCSDK-23308: Setting storage causes the device to reboot in the event of a clean operation
  For non-secure builds, whenever a flash erase while setting storage happens, it causes the device to reboot.
  The same issue can be seen where stored model data is large enough and changes cause defragging or cleaning.
  The EMDS partition is not affected by this.

.. rst-class:: v2-1-1 v2-1-0 v2-0-2 v2-0-1 v2-0-0 v1-9-1 v1-9-0 v1-8-0 v1-7-1

NCSDK-16800: RPL is not cleared on IV index recovery
  After recovering the IV index, a node doesn't clear the replay protection list, which leads to incorrect triggering of the replay attack protection mechanism.

  **Workaround:** Call ``bt_mesh_rpl_reset`` twice after the IV index recovery is done.

.. rst-class:: v2-1-1 v2-1-0 v2-0-2 v2-0-1 v2-0-0 v1-9-1 v1-9-0 v1-8-0 v1-7-1

NCSDK-16798: Friend Subscription List might have duplicate entries
  If a Low Power node loses a Friend Subscription List Add Confirm message, it repeats the request.
  The Friend does not check both the transaction number and the presence of the addresses in the subscription list.
  This causes a situation where the Friend fills the subscription list with duplicate addresses.

.. rst-class:: v2-1-1 v2-1-0 v2-0-2 v2-0-1 v2-0-0

NCSDK-16782: The extended advertiser might not work with Bluetooth Mesh
  Using the extended advertiser instead of the legacy advertiser can lead to getting composition data while provisioning to fail.
  This problem might manifest in the sample :ref:`bluetooth_ble_peripheral_lbs_coex`, as it is using the extended advertiser.

.. rst-class:: v2-1-1 v2-1-0 v2-0-2 v2-0-1 v2-0-0 v1-9-1 v1-9-0

NCSDK-16579: Advertising Node Identity and Network ID might not work with the extended advertiser
  Advertising Node Identity and Network ID do not work with the extended advertising API when the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_ADV_EXT_GATT_SEPARATE` option is enabled.

  **Workaround:** Do not enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_ADV_EXT_GATT_SEPARATE` option.

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0 v2-4-3 v2-4-2 v2-4-1 v2-4-0 v2-3-0 v2-2-0 v2-1-4 v2-1-3 v2-1-2 v2-1-1 v2-1-0 v2-0-2 v2-0-1 v2-0-0 v1-9-1 v1-9-0 v1-8-0 v1-7-1

NCSDK-21780: Sensor types with floating point representation lose precision
  Sensor types with floating point representation lose precision when converted to ``sensor_value`` in the sensor API callbacks.

NCSDK-14399: Legacy advertiser can occasionally do more message retransmissions than requested
  When using the legacy advertiser, the stack sleeps for at least 50 ms after starting advertising a message, which might result in more messages to be advertised than requested.

.. rst-class:: v2-0-2 v2-0-1 v2-0-0 v1-9-1 v1-9-0 v1-8-0 v1-7-1

NCSDK-16061: IV update procedure fails on the device
  Bluetooth Mesh device does not undergo IV update and fails to participate in the procedure initiated by any other node unless it is rebooted after the provisioning.

  **Workaround:** Reboot the device after provisioning.

.. rst-class:: v1-6-1 v1-6-0

NCSDK-10200: The device stops sending Secure Network Beacons after re-provisioning
  Bluetooth Mesh stops sending Secure Network Beacons if the device is re-provisioned after reset through Config Node Reset message or ``bt_mesh_reset()`` call.

  **Workaround:** Reboot the device after re-provisioning.

.. rst-class:: v1-6-1 v1-6-0 v1-5-2 v1-5-1 v1-5-0 v1-4-2 v1-4-1 v1-4-0 v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

NCSDK-5580: nRF5340 only supports SoftDevice Controller
  On nRF5340, only the :ref:`nrfxlib:softdevice_controller` is supported for Bluetooth Mesh.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF5340

Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB)
=========================

The issues in this section are related to the :ref:`ug_esb` protocol.

.. rst-class:: v2-3-0 v2-2-0

NCSDK-20092: ESB does not send packet longer than 63 bytes
  ESB does not support sending packets longer than 63 bytes, but has no such hardware limitation.

KRKNWK-18556: While creating multiple subscriptions, the persistent subscriptions resumption feature works only for the first created subscriptions
  This happens when multiple subscriptions are created by multiple Matter controllers.
  The persistent subscriptions feature will be replaced by the Check In protocol from the Intermittently Connected Devices (ICD) Cluster.

.. rst-class:: v2-6-0 v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0 v2-4-3 v2-4-2 v2-4-1 v2-4-0 v2-3-0 v2-2-0 v2-1-4 v2-1-3 v2-1-2 v2-1-1

KRKNWK-18316: When the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PRINTK_SYNC` Kconfig option is enabled in a Matter over Thread application, the IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver may calculate invalid IEEE 802.15.4 radio frame timestamps
  This is caused by the implementation of synchronous ``printk`` in Zephyr using ``spinlock`` synchronization primitive, which can block Real Time Clock interrupts that are needed by the radio driver to calculate precise timestamps.

  **Workaround:** If it is enabled, disable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PRINTK_SYNC` Kconfig option in your application.

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0 v2-4-3 v2-4-2 v2-4-1 v2-4-0 v2-3-0 v2-2-0 v2-1-4 v2-1-3 v2-1-2 v2-1-1

KRKNWK-18495: The Color Control server's ``RemainingTime`` attribute change may be reported every 100 ms, even though the color temperature value handled by the Color Control server is not modified
  This can result in the Thread network being spammed with unnecessary network traffic when controlling the brightness or color of the :ref:`matter_light_bulb_sample` sample.

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply the commit with the fix to ``sdk-connectedhomeip`` (commit hash: ``3da44025b18d17adacf0a4abf0456c5735399dbd``).

.. rst-class:: v2-3-0 v2-2-0 v2-1-4 v2-1-3 v2-1-2

KRKNWK-18371: The GlobalSceneControl attribute from the OnOff cluster does not change in a way compatible with the Matter specification
  The GlobalSceneControl attribute from the OnOff cluster is not set to ``false`` after receiving the ``OffWithEffect`` command.
  This behavior is not compatible with the Matter specification.

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply the commit with the fix to ``sdk-connectedhomeip`` (commit hash: ``836390ed636ca36126dbcbe763d0f127626cba8d``).

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0

KRKNWK-18315: SPAKE2+ Verifier is not regenerated when using non-default passcode
  When building factory data with a non-default passcode, the SPAKE2+ Verifier is not generated based on the selected passcode value, but uses the default passcode value (``20202021``).

  **Workaround:** Enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_FACTORY_DATA_GENERATE_SPAKE2_VERIFIER` Kconfig option to generate the SPAKE2+ Verifier based on the provided passcode.

KRKNWK-18256: The Matter over Thread device may crash during the processing of the DNS resolve response
  The Matter core implementation handles DNS resolve responses for the Thread platform in a wrong way.
  If the DNS resolve response contains a TXT record with data size equal to 0 (either it is not present or its Time-To-Live (TTL) is equal to 0), the Matter device's application crashes.
  The application behavior for the responses containing a TXT record with data size not equal to 0 is correct.

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply the commit with the fix to ``sdk-connectedhomeip`` (commit hash: ``4997cd70ed53735e302186e7eda1bb28a216199a``).

KRKNWK-18221: Memory leak in the deferred attribute persister
  The ``DeferredAttributePersister`` helper class is used to limit the flash wear for applications that include fast-changing, persistent cluster attributes.
  This class leaks a small heap memory buffer for each deferred attribute write, which can eventually lead to running out of heap memory until the device is rebooted.

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply the commit with the fix to ``sdk-connectedhomeip`` (commit hash: ``e79b0cf44c86ce35dabcf69b50903ac706c67465``).

KRKNWK-17360: Groupcast communication does not work for multiple endpoints that are part of the same group on a single Matter node
  The Matter core implementation handles commands status in a wrong way for those targeted to a group.
  This issue is only visible when adding multiple endpoints that exist on the same Matter node to the same group, and results in an application crash after receiving a group command.
  When adding multiple Matter nodes with a single endpoint each to the same group, the communication works correctly.

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply the commit with the fix to ``sdk-connectedhomeip`` (commit hash: ``99f80de289491ad24a13dda9178a7a24c85324a7``).

KRKNWK-17864: When using Wi-FiÂ® low power mode, the communication with the device might not work after it re-connects to the newly respawned Wi-Fi network
  The communication with Matter over a Wi-Fi device sometimes does not work after it re-connects to the Wi-Fi network.
  The issue is only visible in cases of re-connection to the newly respawned Wi-Fi network that are triggered by rebooting the Wi-Fi access point.
  The root cause of the issue is not known but can be related to the usage of Wi-Fi in low power mode.
  After the application reboot, the device is always able to re-connect to the Wi-Fi network and operate normally.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF7002

  **Workaround:** Disable Wi-Fi low power mode for your application by setting :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_WIFI_LOW_POWER` to ``n`` in the application :file:`prj.conf`.

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0

KRKNWK-17925: The nRF Toolbox application for iOS devices cannot control :ref:`matter_lock_sample` using NUS
  The nRF Toolbox application sends one additional character in all NUS commands, so they are not correctly parsed by the :ref:`matter_lock_sample`.
  The issue was observed only on the nRF Toolbox 5.0.9 version of the iOS system.

KRKNWK-17535: The application core can crash on nRF5340 after the OTA firmware update finishes if the factory data module is enabled
  In the initialization method of the factory data module, the factory data partition and a part of the application image is restricted by Fprotect, which makes it impossible to confirm the new image in the Matter thread.
  Instead, the confirmation must be performed before the factory data module is initialized.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF5340

  **Workaround:** Complete the following steps:

  1. Manually cherry-pick and apply the commit with the fix to ``sdk-connectedhomeip`` (commit hash: ``eeb7280620fff1e16a75cfa41338186fd952c432``).
  #. Add the following lines to the :file:`samples/matter/common/src/ota_util.cpp`:

     .. code-block::

        #include <platform/CHIPDeviceLayer.h>
        #include <zephyr/dfu/mcuboot.h>

            imageProcessor.SetImageConfirmed();
            ChipLogProgress(SoftwareUpdate, "New firmware image confirmed");
          } else {
            ChipLogError(SoftwareUpdate, "Failed to confirm firmware image, it will be reverted on the next boot");
          }
        }

KRKNWK-17151: Application core can crash on nRF5340 when there is a high load on Zephyr's main thread
  The priority of Zephyr's main thread is set to the same value as the IPC thread's priority (``0``).
  Because of this setting, when Zephyr's main thread is working for a long time, an interrupt related to the IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver can occur and the application core can crash due to a lack of communication with the network core.
  To avoid blocking the communication between cores, the main thread priority should have a lower priority than the IPC priority.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF5340

  **Workaround:** Add an additional Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MAIN_THREAD_PRIORITY` set to ``1`` to the build configuration.

KRKNWK-16728: Sleepy device may consume much power when commissioned to a commercial ecosystem
  The controllers in the commercial ecosystem fabric establish a subscription to a Matter device's attributes.
  The controller requests using some subscription intervals, and the Matter device may negotiate other values, but by default it just accepts the requested ones.
  In some cases, the selected intervals can be small, and the Matter device will have to report status very often, which results in high power consumption.

  **Workaround:** Implement ``OnSubscriptionRequested`` method in your application to set values of subscription report intervals that are appropriate for your use case.
  Additionally, register your class implementation to make ``InteractionModelEngine`` use it.
  This is an example of how your implementation could look:

  .. code-block::

     #include <app/ReadHandler.h>

     class SubscriptionApplicationCallback : public chip::app::ReadHandler::ApplicationCallback
     {
        CHIP_ERROR OnSubscriptionRequested(chip::app::ReadHandler & aReadHandler,
                                           chip::Transport::SecureSession & aSecureSession) override;
     };

     CHIP_ERROR SubscriptionApplicationCallback::OnSubscriptionRequested(chip::app::ReadHandler & aReadHandler,
                                                          chip::Transport::SecureSession & aSecureSession)
     {
        /* Set the interval in seconds appropriate for your application use case, e.g. 60 seconds. */
        uint32_t exampleMaxInterval = 60;
        return aReadHandler.SetReportingIntervals(exampleMaxInterval);
     }

  The class implementation can be registered in your application code the following way:

  .. code-block::

      #include <app/InteractionModelEngine.h>

      SubscriptionApplicationCallback myClassInstance;

      chip::app::InteractionModelEngine::GetInstance()->RegisterReadHandlerAppCallback(&myClassInstance);

  You can use the ``ICDUtil`` module implementation that was introduced in the |NCS| v2.4.0 as a reference.

CVE-2023-2626: OpenThread KeyID Mode 2 Security Vulnerability
  This vulnerability impacts all Thread devices using OpenThread and allows an attacker in physical proximity to compromise non-router-capable devices and the entire Thread network in the case of router-capable devices.
  The vulnerability allows an attacker in physical proximity to inject arbitrary IPv6 packets into the Thread network via IEEE 802.15.4 frame transmissions.
  Because the Thread Management Framework (TMF) protocol does not have any additional layer of security, the attacker could exploit this vulnerability to update the Thread Network Key and gain full access to the Thread network.
  There is no known exploitation of vulnerability.

  Due to this issue, the Thread certifications for OpenThread libraries in all |NCS| releases up to v2.4.0 are deprecated.
  OpenThread libraries for selected |NCS| releases were patched with the OpenThread KeyID Mode 2 Security Vulnerability fix and re-certified by inheritance.
  The libraries are available through a DevZone request.

KRKNWK-12115: Simultaneous commissioning of many devices can cause the Coordinator device to assert
  The Zigbee Coordinator device can assert when multiple devices are being commissioned simultaneously.
  In some cases, the device can end up in the low memory state as the result.

  **Workaround:** To lower the likelihood of the Coordinator device asserting, increase its scheduler queue and buffer pool by completing the following steps:

  1. Create your own custom memory configuration file by creating an empty header file for your application, similar to :file:`include/zb_mem_config_custom.h` header file in the :ref:`Zigbee light switch <zigbee_light_switch_sample>` sample.
  #. Copy the contents of :file:`zb_mem_config_max.h` memory configuration file to the memory configuration header file you have just created.
     The Zigbee Network Coordinator sample uses the contents of the memory configuration file by default.
  #. In your custom memory configuration file, locate the following code:

     .. code-block:: c

        /* Now if you REALLY know what you do, you can study zb_mem_config_common.h and redefine some configuration parameters, like:
        #undef ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE
        #define ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE 56
        */

  #. Replace the code you have just located with the following code:

     .. code-block:: c

        /* Increase Scheduler queue size. */
        undef ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE
        define ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE XYZ
        /* Increase buffer pool size. */
        undef ZB_CONFIG_IOBUF_POOL_SIZE
        define ZB_CONFIG_IOBUF_POOL_SIZE XYZ

  #. To increase the scheduler queue size, replace ``XYZ`` next to ``ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE`` with the value of your choice, ranging from ``48U`` to ``256U``.
  #. To increase the buffer pool size, replace ``XYZ`` next to ``ZB_CONFIG_IOBUF_POOL_SIZE`` with the value of your choice, ranging from ``48U`` to ``127U``.

KRKNWK-11826: Zigbee Router does not accept new child devices if the maximum number of children is reached
  Once the maximum number of children devices on a Zigbee Router is reached and one of them leaves the network, the Zigbee Router does not update the flags inside beacon frames to indicate that it cannot accept new devices.

  **Workaround:** If the maximum number of child devices has been reached, call ``bdb_start_top_level_commissioning(ZB_BDB_NETWORK_STEERING)`` on the parent router from the ``ZB_ZDO_SIGNAL_LEAVE_INDICATION`` signal handler.

KRKNWK-12017: Zigbee End Device does not recover from broken rejoin procedure
  If the Device Announcement packet is not acknowledged by the End Device's parent, joiner logic is stopped and the device does not recover.

  **Workaround:** Complete the following steps to detect when the rejoin procedure breaks and reset the device:

  1. Introduce helper variable ``joining_signal_received``.
  #. Extend ``zigbee_default_signal_handler()`` by completing the following steps:

     a. Set ``joining_signal_received`` to ``true`` in the following signals: ``ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_DEVICE_FIRST_START``, ``ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_DEVICE_REBOOT``, ``ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_STEERING``.
     #. If ``leave_type`` is set to ``ZB_NWK_LEAVE_TYPE_REJOIN``, set ``joining_signal_received`` to ``false`` in the ``ZB_ZDO_SIGNAL_LEAVE`` signal.
     #. Handle the ``ZB_NLME_STATUS_INDICATION`` signal to detect when End Device failed to transmit packet to its parent, reported by signal's status ``ZB_NWK_COMMAND_STATUS_PARENT_LINK_FAILURE``.

  See the following snippet for an example:

  .. code-block:: c

     /* Add helper variable that will be used for detecting broken rejoin procedure. */
     /* Flag indicating if joining signal has been received since restart or leave with rejoin. */

KRKNWK-11602: Zigbee device becomes not operable after receiving malformed packet
  When any Zigbee device receives a malformed packet that does not match the Zigbee packet structure, the ZBOSS stack asserts.
  In the |NCS| versions before the v1.9.0 release, the device is not automatically restarted.

  **Workaround:** Depends on your version of the |NCS|:

  * Before the |NCS| v1.9.0: Power-cycle the Zigbee device.
  * After and including the |NCS| v1.9.0: Wait for the device to restart automatically.

Given these two options, we recommend to upgrade your |NCS| version to the latest available one.

External antenna performance setting
  The preprogrammed Asset Tracker does not come with the best external antenna performance.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF9160

  **Workaround:** If you are using nRF9160 DK v0.15.0 or higher and Thingy:91 v1.4.0 or higher, set :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF9160_GPS_ANTENNA_EXTERNAL` to ``y``.
  Alternatively, for nRF9160 DK v0.15.0, you can set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF9160_GPS_COEX0_STRING` option to ``AT%XCOEX0`` when building the preprogrammed Asset Tracker to achieve the best external antenna performance.

Serial LTE Modem
================

The issues in this section are related to the :ref:`serial_lte_modem` application.

.. rst-class:: wontfix v2-6-0 v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0 v2-4-3 v2-4-2 v2-4-1 v2-4-0

NCSDK-20457: Modem traces captured through UART are corrupted if RTT logs are simultaneously captured
  When capturing modem traces through UART with `Cellular Monitor`_ app and simultaneously capturing RTT logs, for example, with J-Link RTT Viewer, the modem trace misses packets, and captured packets might have incorrect information.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF9160, nRF9161

  **Workaround:** If you need to capture modem traces and RTT logs at the same time, add the following change to :file:`nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns.overlay` or :file:`nrf9161dk_nrf9161_ns.overlay`, depending on the board you are using.
  Otherwise, you can choose not to capture RTT logs.
  Having RTT logs enabled does not cause this issue.

  .. parsed-literal::
     :class: highlight

     &uart1 {
      hw-flow-control;
     };

  This increases the overall power consumption even when Serial LTE Modem is in sleep mode.

.. rst-class:: v2-6-0 v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0

NCSDK-24135: Serial LTE Modem (SLM) attempts to use UART hardware flow control even though Connectivity bridge does not support it
  With Thingy:91, Connectivity bridge in the nRF52840 SoC terminates the USB traffic and sends the traffic through UART to SLM in the nRF9160 SiP.
  The Connectivity bridge does not enable UART hardware flow control and since both ends need to enable it, SLM should not enable it either.
  Without hardware flow control, the buffer sizes must be set accordingly for the worst-case scenario.
  In this case, SLM uses the default buffer size of 3x256 bytes and will drop incoming UART traffic after the buffers are full.

  **Affected platforms:** Thingy:91

  **Workaround:** Set the :ref:`CONFIG_SLM_UART_RX_BUF_SIZE <CONFIG_SLM_UART_RX_BUF_SIZE>` Kconfig option to ``2048`` to ensure that there is adequate buffer space to receive traffic from the Connectivity Bridge and disable the hw-flow-control from :file:`boards\thingy91_nrf9160_ns.overlay`.
  If even larger buffer spaces are required, the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BRIDGE_BUF_SIZE` Kconfig option for Connectivity Bridge and the :ref:`CONFIG_SLM_UART_RX_BUF_SIZE <CONFIG_SLM_UART_RX_BUF_SIZE>` Kconfig option for SLM, must be set accordingly.

NCSDK-23733: Full modem firmware update issue on the nRF9161 DK
  Failures of full modem firmware update on the nRF9161 DK have been observed in certain conditions.
  If RTT is enabled (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT` set to ``y``) and connected during the activation of the new firmware (when the modem or the device is reset), the update can fail with: ``XFOTA: 5,1,-116``

  **Affected platforms:** nRF9161

  **Workaround:** Make sure that RTT is disconnected when activating the new firmware.
  It can be disconnected right before triggering the reset and connected back once the update is complete.

NCSDK-13895: Build failure for target Thingy:91 with secure_bootloader overlay
  Building the application for Thingy:91 fails if ``secure_bootloader`` overlay is included.

  **Affected platforms:** Thingy:91, nRF9160

.. rst-class:: v2-3-0

NCSDK-20047: SLM logging over RTT is not available
  There is a conflict with MCUboot RTT logging.
  In order to save power, SLM configures MCUboot to use RTT instead of UART for logging.
  SLM itself uses RTT for logging as well.
  With a recent change, MCUboot exclusively takes control of the RTT logging, which causes the conflict.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF9160

  **Workaround:** Remove ``CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT=y`` and ``CONFIG_RTT_CONSOLE=y`` from :file:`child_image\mcuboot.conf`.

.. rst-class:: v1-0-0 v0-4-0 v0-3-0

Modem FW reset on debugger connection through SWD
  If a debugger (for example, J-Link) is connected through SWD to the nRF9160, the modem firmware will reset.
  Therefore, the LTE modem cannot be operational during debug sessions.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF9160

nRF Desktop
===========

The issues in this section are related to the :ref:`nrf_desktop` application.

.. note::
    nRF Desktop is also affected by the Bluetooth LE issue :ref:`NCSDK-19865 <ncsdk_19865>`.

.. rst-class:: v2-4-3 v2-4-2 v2-4-1 v2-4-0 v2-3-0 v2-2-0 v2-1-4 v2-1-3 v2-1-2 v2-1-1 v2-1-0

NCSDK-23704: Too small heap size on nRF5340 DK
  The heap memory pool size (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE`) is too small, which may cause an Event Manager out of memory (OOM) error in runtime.
  Too small heap size might also lead to issues when allocating memory for UUID in :ref:`gatt_dm_readme` during peer discovery, because the library also uses the heap to allocate internal data.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF5340 DK

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply commit with fix from ``main`` (commit hash: ``be97ae3074c38b7987d5183b1c09995cf19d61e8``).

.. rst-class:: v2-5-2 v2-5-1 v2-5-0 v2-4-3 v2-4-2 v2-4-1 v2-4-0 v2-3-0 v2-2-0 v2-1-4 v2-1-3 v2-1-2 v2-1-1 v2-1-0 v2-0-2 v2-0-1 v2-0-0 v1-9-2 v1-9-1 v1-9-0 v1-8-0 v1-7-1 v1-7-0

NCSDK-25928: :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_state` keeps sending empty HID reports to lower priority subscriber after higher priority subscriber connects
  After a higher priority subscriber connects, the :ref:`nrf_desktop_hid_state` sends empty HID reports to a lower priority subscriber to report release of all pressed buttons.
  Because of an implementation bug related to invalid handling of empty report data (accessing memory under ``NULL`` pointer), the empty HID reports are sent to the lower priority subscriber in a never-ending loop (an empty HID report with a given ID is expected to be sent once).
  The issue replicates if an nRF Desktop peripheral connects to the host over USB while maintaining Bluetooth LE connection.

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply the commit with the fix from the ``main`` branch (commit hash: ``a87407fc29514b68a7bdaea5554f7b755466a77b``).

NCSDK-8304: HID configurator issues for peripherals connected over Bluetooth LE to Linux host
  Using :ref:`nrf_desktop_config_channel_script` for peripherals connected to host directly over Bluetooth LE might result in receiving improper HID feature report ID.
  In such case, the device will provide HID input reports, but it cannot be configured with the HID configurator.

  **Workaround:** Use BlueZ in version 5.56 or higher.

NCSDK-22953: A HID output report interrupts scanning in the :ref:`nrf_desktop_ble_scan` even if there are no peripherals connected
  Connecting a HID dongle over USB to a HID host might lead to submitting a HID output report and stopping Bluetooth LE scanning even if there are no peripherals connected through the dongle.
  In this case, scanning stop delays establishing a connection with peripherals.

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply the commit with the fix from the ``main`` branch (commit hash: ``b4860f7c9475ff8e61a4c3b907968987bb6311bd``).

NCSDK-22810: Assertion fail when logging :c:struct:`config_event` with an unknown status
  The :c:member:`config_event.status` field is set according to data received from the host computer over :ref:`nrf_desktop_config_channel`.
  Setting it to a value unknown to an nRF Desktop device should not cause assertion failure.

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply the commit with the fix from the ``main`` branch (commit hash: ``a49008a980dbddcb48c80736f76fedbfda9c03f6``).

NCSDK-20366: Possible bus fault in :ref:`nrf_desktop_selector` while toggling a hardware selector
  The GPIO port index calculation in the GPIO interrupt handling function assumes that GPIO devices in Zephyr are placed in memory next to each other with order matching GPIO port indexes, which might not be true.
  Using an invalid port index in the function leads to undefined behavior.

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply the commit with the fix from the ``main`` branch (commit hash: ``6179413498d1ae1c9c79255aeca2739d108e482d``).

NCSDK-19970: MCUboot bootloader fails to swap images on nRF52840 DK that uses external flash
   The MCUboot bootloader cannot access external flash because the chosen ``nordic,pm-ext-flash`` is not defined in the MCUboot child image's devicetree.
   As a result ``nrf52840dk_nrf52840`` using ``prj_mcuboot_qspi.conf`` configuration fails to swap images after a complete image transfer.

   **Affected platforms:** nRF52840

   **Workaround**: Manually cherry-pick and apply the commit with the fix from the ``main`` branch (commit hash: ``7cea1b7e681a39ce2e2143b6b03132d95b7606ab``).

NCSDK-19347: NFC Reader samples return false errors with value ``1``
  The :c:func:`nfc_t4t_isodep_transmit` function of the :ref:`nfc_t4t_isodep_readme` library can return ``1`` as error code even if a delayed operation has been scheduled correctly and should return ``0``.
  This happens when the ISO-DEP frame is sent for the first time.
  In samples, this error is propagated from the higher level :c:func:`nfc_t4t_hl_procedure_ndef_tag_app_select` function.
  The :ref:`tnep_poller_readme` library operations can call the application error callback with error code ``1``, meaning that a delayed operation has been scheduled successfully.

  **Workaround:** Ignore the :ref:`tnep_poller_readme` error callback with error value ``1``.
  Treat the return value ``1`` of the functions :c:func:`nfc_t4t_isodep_transmit` and :c:func:`nfc_t4t_hl_procedure_ndef_tag_app_select` as success.

NCSDK-18847: :ref:`radio_test` sample does not build with support for Skyworks front-end module
  When building a sample with support for a front-end module different from nRF21540, the sample uses a non-existing configuration to initialize TX power data.
  This causes a compilation error because the source file containing code for a generic front-end module is not included in the build.

  **Workaround:** Do not use the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_RADIO_TEST_POWER_CONTROL_AUTOMATIC` Kconfig option and replace ``CONFIG_GENERIC_FEM`` with ``CONFIG_MPSL_FEM_SIMPLE_GPIO`` in the :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file of the sample.

TNSW-46156: The :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library can in some cases trigger a modem bug related to PDN deactivation (AT+CGACT) in NB-IoT mode
  This causes excessive network signaling which can make interactions with the modem (AT commands or :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem` functions) hang for several minutes.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF9160

  **Workaround:** Add a small delay before PDN deactivation as shown in `Pull Request #10379 <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/pull/10379>`_.

NCSDK-18746: The :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library fails to complete non-secure bootstrap when using a custom URI and the default security tag
  If the LwM2M carrier library is operating in generic mode (not connecting to any of the predefined supported carriers), and the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_CARRIER_CUSTOM_URI` is set to connect to a non-secure server, the library attempts to retrieve a PSK from :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_CARRIER_SERVER_SEC_TAG` even though a PSK is not needed for the non-secure bootstrap.
  The PSK in this ``sec_tag`` is not used, but reading the ``sec_tag`` causes the bootstrap to fail if the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_CARRIER_SERVER_SEC_TAG` is set to the default value (``0``).

  **Affected platforms:** nRF9160

  **Workaround:** Assign any non-zero value to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_CARRIER_SERVER_SEC_TAG`.

NCSDK-12912: The :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library does not recover if initial network connection fails
  When the device is switched on, if :cpp:func:`lte_lc_connect()` returns an error at timeout, it will cause :cpp:func:`lwm2m_carrier_init()` to fail.
  Thus, the device will fail to connect to carrier device management servers.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF9160

  **Workaround:** Increase :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTE_NETWORK_TIMEOUT` to allow :ref:`lte_lc_readme` more time to successfully connect.

NCSDK-12913: The :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library will fail to initialize if phone number is not present in SIM
  The SIM phone number is needed during the :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library start-up.
  For new SIM cards, it might take some time before the phone number is received by the network.
  The LwM2M carrier library does not wait for this to happen.
  Thus, the device can fail to connect to the carrier's device management servers.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF9160

  **Workaround:** Use one of the following workarounds:

  * Reboot or power-cycle the device after the SIM has received a phone number from the network.
  * Apply the following commits, depending on your |NCS| version:

    * `v1.7-branch <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/pull/6287>`_
    * `v1.6-branch <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/pull/6286>`_

NCSDK-13106: When replacing a Verizon SIM card, the :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library does not reconnect to the device management servers
  When a Verizon SIM card is replaced with a new Verizon SIM card, the library fails to fetch the correct PSK for the bootstrap server.
  Thus, the device fails to connect to the carrier's device management servers.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF9160

  **Workaround:** Use one of the following workarounds:

  * Use the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_CARRIER_USE_CUSTOM_PSK` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_CARRIER_CUSTOM_PSK` configuration options to set the appropriate PSK needed for Verizon test or live servers.
    This PSK can be obtain from the carrier.
  * After inserting a new SIM card, reboot the device again.

NCSDK-15707: Visual glitches when updating an RGB LED's color in :ref:`caf_leds`
  Due to changes in the default DTS of the boards, the default PWM period has been increased.
  The first LED channel is updated one PWM period before other channels.
  This causes visual glitches for LEDs with more than one color channel when the LED color is being updated.
  A shorter LED PWM period mitigates the observed issue.
  See :ref:`caf_leds` for more information.

  **Workaround:** Make sure your application includes the devicetree overlay file in which PWM period is decreased.
  For example, include the following commit to solve the issue for the :ref:`nrf_machine_learning_app` application for Nordic Thingy:53: ``fa2b57cddbaacf393c77def5d0302e1a45138d21``.

NCSIDB-925: Event subscribers in the :ref:`app_event_manager` may overlap when using a non-default naming convention
  In order to locate the event subscribers start and stop address ranges, sections have to be sorted by the name with added postfixes.
  Hence, using a non-default event naming scheme may break the expected subscribers sorting.
  In this situation, one of the event subscribers arrays might be placed inside the other.
  So, when the event related to the outer subscribers is processed, the event subscribers that are inside are also executed.
  To resolve this issue, a new implementation was introduced that uses a section naming that cannot be used as event name (invalid variable identifier).

  **Workaround:** Use the default event names, ensuring that each event name ends with the ``_event`` postfix.
  Make sure that the event name does not start the same way as another event.
  For example, creating the following events: ``rx_event`` and ``rx_event_error_event`` would still cause the issue.

NCSDK-15512: Modem traces retrieval incompatible with TF-M
  Enabling modem traces with :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_UART_NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE_BACKEND_UART` set to ``y`` will disable TF-M logging from secure processing environment (using :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_LOG_LEVEL_SILENCE` set to ``y``) including output from hardware fault handlers.

CIA-351: Connectivity issues with :ref:`lib_azure_iot_hub`
  If a ``device-bound`` message is sent to the device while it is in the LTE Power Saving Mode (PSM), the TCP connection will most likely be terminated by the server.
  Known symptoms of this are frequent reconnections to cloud, messages sent to Azure IoT Hub never arriving, and FOTA images being downloaded twice.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF9160

  **Workaround:** Avoid using LTE Power Saving Mode (PSM) and extended DRX intervals longer than approximately 30 seconds. This will reduce the risk of the issue occurring, at the cost of increased power consumption.

NCSDK-23315: The :ref:`bt_le_adv_prov_readme` has an incorrect range and default value for the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ADV_PROV_FAST_PAIR_ADV_BUF_SIZE` Kconfig option
  The buffer size has not been aligned to the new Fast Pair not discoverable advertising data size after size of the salt included in the data was increased from 1 byte to 2 bytes.
  Too small default buffer size results in an assertion failure when generating an advertising data for the Fast Pair not discoverable advertising with five Account Keys and the Battery Notification enabled.
  The assertion failure replicates in the :ref:`fast_pair_input_device` sample.

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply the commit with the fix from the ``main`` branch (commit hash: ``a8b668e82837295962348e9e681125c2ae11bb4e``).

NCSDK-20567: When building an application for MCUboot, the build system does not check whether the compiled application is too big for being an update image
  In this case the update cannot be applied, because the swap algorithm requires some free space in the secondary slot (even if the image fits inside the slot).
  Check the size requirements in the :ref:`MCUboot documentation <mcuboot:mcuboot_index_ncs>`.

NCSIDB-816: nanopb/protoc not specified correctly by the |NCS| Toolchain
  The |NCS| Toolchain includes the nanopb/protoc tool when installed, but the path to the tool is not propagated correctly to the |NCS| build system.

  **Workaround:** Locate the nanopb :file:`generator-bin` directory in your |NCS| Toolchain and add its path to your system's global path.
  This makes the protoc tool executable findable.

NCSDK-6117: Build configuration issues
  The build configuration consisting of :ref:`bootloader`, Secure Partition Manager, and application does not work.
  (The SPM has been deprecated with the |NCS| v2.1.0.)

  **Workaround:** Either include MCUboot in the build or use MCUboot instead of the immutable bootloader.

NCSDK-10672: :file:`dfu_application.zip` is not updated during build
  In the configuration with MCUboot, the :file:`dfu_application.zip` might not be properly updated after code or configuration changes, because of missing dependencies.

  **Workaround:** Clear the build if :file:`dfu_application.zip` is going to be released to make sure that it is up to date.

NCSDK-9786: Wrong FLASH_PAGE_ERASE_MAX_TIME_US for the nRF53 network core
  ``FLASH_PAGE_ERASE_MAX_TIME_US`` defines the execution window duration when doing the flash operation synchronously along the radio operations (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_PARTIAL_ERASE` not enabled).

  The ``FLASH_PAGE_ERASE_MAX_TIME_US`` value of the nRF53 network core is lower than required.
  For this reason, if :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_RADIO_SYNC_MPSL` is set to ``y`` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_PARTIAL_ERASE` is set to ``n``, a flash erase operation on the nRF5340 network core will result in an MPSL timeslot OVERSTAYED assert.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF5340

  **Workaround:** Increase ``FLASH_PAGE_ERASE_MAX_TIME_US`` (defined in :file:`ncs/zephyr/soc/arm/nordic_nrf/nrf53/soc.h`) from 44850UL to 89700UL (the same value as for the application core).

NCSDK-6898: Overriding child images
  Adding child image overlay from the :file:`CMakeLists.txt` top-level file located in the :file:`samples` directory overrides the existing child image overlay.

  **Workaround:** Apply the configuration from the overlay to the child image manually.

NCSDK-6777: Project out of date when :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT` is set
  The DFU :file:`.zip` file is regenerated even when no changes are made to the files it depends on.
  As a consequence, SES displays a "Project out of date" message even when the project is not out of date.

  **Workaround:** Apply the fix from `sdk-nrf PR #3241 <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/pull/3241>`_.

NCSDK-6848: MCUboot must be built from source when included
  The build will fail if either :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_BUILD_STRATEGY_SKIP_BUILD` or :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_BUILD_STRATEGY_USE_HEX_FILE` is set.

  **Workaround:** Set :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_BUILD_STRATEGY_FROM_SOURCE` instead.

KRKNWK-7827: Application build system is not aware of the settings partition
  The application build system is not aware of partitions, including the settings partition, which can result in application code overlapping with other partitions.
  As a consequence, writing to overlapping partitions might remove or damage parts of the firmware, which can lead to errors that are difficult to debug.

  **Workaround:** Define and use a code partition to shrink the effective flash memory available for the application.
  You can use one of the following solutions:

  * :ref:`partition_manager` from |NCS| - see the page for all configuration options.
    For example, for single image (without bootloader and with the settings partition used), set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_SINGLE_IMAGE` Kconfig option to ``y`` and define the value for :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_PARTITION_SIZE_SETTINGS_STORAGE` to the required settings storage size.
  * :ref:`Devicetree code partition <zephyr:flash_map_api>` from Zephyr.
    Set :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USE_DT_CODE_PARTITION` Kconfig option to ``y``.
    Make sure that the code partition is defined and chosen correctly (``offset`` and ``size``).

.. rst-class:: v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

Flash commands only program one core
  ``west flash`` and ``ninja flash`` only program one core, even if multiple cores are included in the build.

  **Workaround:** Execute the flash command from inside the build directory of the child image that is placed on the other core (for example, :file:`build/hci_rpmsg`).

NCSDK-11234: Statically defined "pcd_sram" partition might cause ARM usage fault
  Inconsistency between SRAM memory partitions in Partition Manager and DTS could lead to improper memory usage.
  For example, one SRAM region might be used for multiple purposes at the same time.

  **Workaround:** Ensure that partitions defined by DTS and Partition Manager are consistent.

NCSDK-7234: UART output is not received from the network core
  The UART output is not received from the network core if the application core is programmed and running with a non-secure image (using the ``nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp_ns`` build target).

  **Affected platforms:** nRF5340

NCSDK-7982: Partition manager: Incorrect partition size linkage from name conflict
  The partition manager will incorrectly link a partition's size to the size of its container if the container partition's name matches its child image's name in :file:`CMakeLists.txt`.
  This can cause the inappropriately-sized partition to overwrite another partition beyond its intended boundary.

  **Workaround:** Rename the container partitions in the :file:`pm.yml` and :file:`pm_static.yml` files to something that does not match the child images' names, and rename the child images' main image partition to its name in :file:`CMakeLists.txt`.

.. rst-class:: v1-3-2 v1-3-1 v1-3-0

Missing :file:`CMakeLists.txt`
  The :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file for developing applications that emulate nRF52820 on the nRF52833 DK is missing.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF52833, nRF52820

  **Workaround:** Create a :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file in the :file:`ncs/zephyr/boards/arm/nrf52833dk_nrf52820` folder with the following content:

  .. parsed-literal::
    :class: highlight

    zephyr_compile_definitions(DEVELOP_IN_NRF52833)
    zephyr_compile_definitions(NRFX_COREDEP_DELAY_US_LOOP_CYCLES=3)

  You can `download this file <nRF52820 CMakeLists.txt_>`_ from the upstream Zephyr repository.
  After you add it, the file is automatically included by the build system.

Bootloader

NCSDK-24203: If fault injection hardening (FIH) is enabled, a bug is observed in the :c:func:`boot_image_check_hook` function
  Due to this, multicore applications cannot be booted for nRF5340 MCUboot builds with simultaneous multimage update enabled.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF5340, Thingy:53

  **Workaround:** Disable fault injection hardening (FIH) or cherry-pick the commit in `PR #12846 <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/pull/12846>`_.

.. rst-class:: v2-4-3 v2-4-2 v2-4-0 v2-4-1

NCSDK-23761: MCUboot fails to boot when both the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_HW_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOT_FIH_PROFILE_LOW` Kconfig options are enabled
  The MCUboot downgrade prevention mechanism relies on platform-specific implementation of hardware security counters.
  The |NCS| implementation of the hardware security counters is not compatible with the fault injection hardening code (FIH) of MCUboot.
  In the |NCS|, the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOT_FIH_PROFILE_LOW` of MCUboot is enabled by default for TF-M builds.
  You can enable the MCUboot Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_HW_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION` in the |NCS| using the option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_HARDWARE_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION`.

  **Workaround:** To fix the issue, disable either the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_HW_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION` or :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOT_FIH_PROFILE_LOW` Kconfig option in MCUboot.

NCSDK-21379: Single slot network core updates on nRF5340 does not work properly
  Currently, a bug in the MCUboot code causes network core updates to not be applied when using the nRF5340 in a single slot configuration.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF5340

  **Workaround:** Use one of the following workarounds:

  * Enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOT_IMAGE_ACCESS_HOOKS` Kconfig option and copy the routine for updating the network core from :file:`loader.c` in MCUboot or :file:`nrf53_hooks.c`.
  * Use the dual-slot configuration of MCUboot.

NCSDK-11308: Powering off device immediately after serial recovery of the nRF53 network core firmware results in broken firmware
  The network core will not be able to boot if the device is powered off too soon after completing a serial recovery update procedure of the network core firmware.
  This is because the firmware is being copied from shared RAM to network core flash **after** mcumgr indicates that the serial recovery procedure has completed.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF5340

  **Workaround:** Use one of the following workarounds:

  * Wait for 30 seconds before powering off the device after performing serial recovery of the nRF53 network core firmware.
  * Re-upload the network core firmware with a new serial recovery procedure if the device was powered off too soon in a previous procedure.

NCSDK-6238: Socket API calls might hang when using Download client
  When using the :ref:`lib_download_client` library with HTTP (without TLS), the application might not process incoming fragments fast enough, which can starve the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem` buffers and make calls to the Modem library hang.
  Samples and applications that are affected include those that use :ref:`lib_download_client` to download files through HTTP, or those that use :ref:`lib_fota_download` with modem updates enabled.

  **Workaround:** Set :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DOWNLOAD_CLIENT_RANGE_REQUESTS`.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0

Jobs not received after reset
  When using :ref:`lib_aws_fota`, no new jobs are received on the device if the device is reset during a firmware upgrade or loses the MQTT connection.

NCSDK-24305: fota_download library sends FOTA_DOWNLOAD_EVT_FINISHED when unable to connect
  The :ref:`lib_download_client` library does not resume a download if the device cannot connect to a target server.
  This causes the :ref:`lib_fota_download` library to incorrectly assume that the download has completed.

  **Workaround:** Set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FOTA_SOCKET_RETRIES` Kconfig option to ``0``.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0

Stalled download
  :ref:`lib_fota_download` does not resume a download if the device loses the connection.

Download stopped on socket connection timeout
  In the nRF9160: AWS FOTA and :ref:`http_application_update_sample` samples, the download is stopped if the socket connection times out before the modem can delete the modem firmware.
  A fix for this issue is available in commit `38625ba7 <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/commit/38625ba775adda3cdc7dbf516eeb3943c7403227>`_.

  **Workaround:** Call :cpp:func:`fota_download_start` again with the same arguments.

.. rst-class:: v1-1-0

Update event triggered by an error event
  If the last fragment of a :ref:`lib_fota_download` is received but is corrupted, or if the last write is unsuccessful, the library emits an error event as expected.
  However, it also emits an apply/request update event, even though the downloaded data is invalid.

.. rst-class:: v1-0-0 v0-4-0

FW upgrade is broken for multi-image builds
  Firmware upgrade using mcumgr or USB DFU is broken for multi-image builds, because the devicetree configuration is not used.

CIA-892: Assert or crash when printing long strings with the ``%s`` qualifier
  When logging a string with the ``%s`` qualifier, the maximum length of any inserted string is 1022 bytes.
  If the string is longer, an assert or a crash can occur.
  Given that the default value of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOG_PRINTK` Kconfig option has been changed from ``n`` to ``y`` in the |NCS| v2.3.0 release, the :c:func:`printk` function may also cause this issue, unless the application disables this option.

NCSDK-11684: Failure loading KMU registers on nRF9160 devices
  Certain builds will experience problems loading HUK to KMU due to a bug in nrf_cc3xx_platform library prior to version 0.9.12.
  The problem arises in certain builds depending on alignment of code.
  The reason for the issue is improper handling of PAN 7 on nRF9160 devices.

  The :cpp:func:`mutex_free_platform` function has a bug where a call to :cpp:func:`k_mem_slab_free` provides wrong indirection on a parameter to free the platform mutex.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF9160

  **Workaround:** Write the call to free the mutex in the following way: ``k_mem_slab_free(&mutex_slab, &mutex->mutex)``.
  The change adds ``&`` before the parameter ``mutex->mutex``.

NRF91-1702: The modem may fail to attach to the network after a modem firmware update if the application core was not rebooted
  Performing a modem delta update without rebooting the application core (to reinitialize the modem and run the new firmware) may lead to a UICC initialization failure.
  The UICC failure can be confirmed by issuing the ``AT+CEREG?`` AT command to read the current network registration status after attempting a UICC activation.
  In case of the failure, the returned network registration status is ``90``.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF9160
  **Affect modem firmware versions:** v1.3.4 and v1.3.5

  **Workaround:** Reinitialize the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem` by calling :c:func:`nrf_modem_lib_shutdown` followed by :c:func:`nrf_modem_lib_init`,
  or reboot the application core as done in the existing |NCS| samples and applications.

KRKNWK-18545: The device may enter a livelock state if AES encryption is done in a thread
  This can happen when the nRF 802.15.4 Radio Driver's multiprotocol feature is used together with Bluetooth LE (SoftDevice Controller).

  **Workaround:** When using the nRF 802.15.4 Radio Driver's multiprotocol feature together with SoftDevice Controller, do not use the :file:`sdc_soc.h` API, select the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_CRYPTO` Kconfig option, or issue the ``HCI LE Encrypt`` command.

KRKNWK-16976: multiprotocol_rpmsg application on nRF5340 network core occasionally crashes when Matter weather station application is stress tested
  The root cause of this issue is not known.
  When nRF5340 network core crashes it can hang or silently reset (see :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_RESET_ON_FATAL_ERROR`).
  The |NCS| does not provide a feature to allow the nRF5340 application core to detect a reset or failure of the nRF5340 network core and react properly (possibly resetting whole nRF5340 SoC).

  **Affected platforms:** nRF5340

  **Workaround:** Implement own mechanism to allow detection on nRF5340 application core a reset or crash of nRF5340 network core and react according to own requirements.

KRKNWK-6756: 802.15.4 Service Layer (SL) library support for the nRF53
  The binary variant of the 802.15.4 Service Layer (SL) library for the nRF53 does not support such features as synchronization of **TIMER** with **RTC** or timestamping of received frames.
  For this reason, 802.15.4 features like delayed transmission or delayed reception are not available for the nRF53.

KRKNWK-6255: RSSI parameter adjustment is not applied
  The RADIO: RSSI parameter adjustment errata (153 for nRF52840, 225 for nRF52833 and nRF52820, 87 for nRF5340) are not applied for RSSI, LQI, Energy Detection, and CCA values used by the 802.15.4 protocol.
  There is an expected offset up to +/- 6 dB in extreme temperatures of values based on RSSI measurement.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF5340, nRF52840, nRF52833, nRF52820

  **Workaround:** To apply RSSI parameter adjustments, cherry-pick the commits in `hal_nordic PR #88 <https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/hal_nordic/pull/88>`_, `sdk-nrfxlib PR #381 <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrfxlib/pull/381>`_, and `sdk-zephyr PR #430 <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-zephyr/pull/430>`_.

SoftDevice Controller
=====================

The issues in this section are related to :ref:`nrfxlib:softdevice_controller`.
In addition to the known issues listed here, see also :ref:`softdevice_controller_limitations` for permanent limitations.

.. rst-class:: v2-6-0

DRGN-21619: The controller might assert if the CIS peripheral stops receiving packets from the CIS central
  This only occurs when the window widening reaches at least half of the ISO interval in magnitude.
  Assuming worst case clock accuracies on both the central and the peripheral, this could occur with a supervision timeout of 2.4, 3.7, or 4.9 seconds, corresponding to an ISO interval of 5, 7.5, or 10 milliseconds, respectively.

  **Workaround:** Set the supervision timeout to a value lower than those mentioned above.

DRGN-21605: Value read by HCI ISO Read TX Timestamp is off by 40 Âµs
  The HCI command ``Iso Read Tx Tmestamp`` returns the last assigned sync reference for the ISO TX path and the value might be off by 40 Âµs.

.. rst-class:: v2-6-0

DRGN-21293: The LE Read ISO TX Sync command is implemented according to the raised errata ES-23138
  In ES-23138, the return parameter ``TX_Time_Stamp`` is used as the SDU synchronization reference of the SDU previously scheduled for transmission.
  This differs from the Bluetooth Core Specification v5.4, which uses the CIG or BIG reference anchor point as the SDU synchronization reference.
  When the CIG or BIG is configured with an ``ISO_Interval`` that equals the ``SDU_Interval``, there is no difference between the CIG or BIG reference anchor point and the SDU synchronization reference.
  If several SDUs are transmitted during each ``ISO_Interval``, meaning that it is larger than the ``SDU_Interval``, our implementation of the LE Read ISO TX Sync command returns a unique SDU synchronization reference for each SDU.

DRGN-15531: The coding scheme provided by the LE Set PHY HCI Command is ignored after a remote initiated PHY procedure
  The PHY options set by the host in LE Set PHY command are reverted when the remote initiates a PHY update.
  This happens because of the automatic reply of a PHY update Request in the SoftDevice Controller.
  This makes it impossible to change the PHY preferred coding in both directions.

DRGN-15465: Corrupted advertising data when :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_EXT_ADV` is set
  Setting scan response data for a legacy advertiser on a build with extended advertising support corrupts parts of the advertising data.
  When using ``BT_LE_ADV_OPT_USE_NAME`` (which is the default configuration in most samples), the device name is put in the scan response.
  This corrupts the advertising data.

  **Workaround:** Do not set scan response data.
  That implies not using the ``BT_LE_ADV_OPT_USE_NAME`` option, or the :c:macro:`BT_LE_ADV_CONN_NAME` macro when initializing Bluetooth.
  Instead, use :c:macro:`BT_LE_ADV_CONN`, and if necessary set the device name in the advertising data manually.

KRKNWK-17343: Accessories become significantly slower when some data pairs in the non-volatile storage (NVS) change frequently
  Accessing data pairs that rarely change can take a long time.
  It might happen, for example, in case of long booting or paired/unpaired identify response time, which can lead to certification issues.
  During the certification, the accessory is subjected to multiple resets and pair/unpair processes, which causes the NVS to store a large amount of new data pairs.
  As a result, the accessory does not pass the certification test cases exceeding the maximum operation time (for example, TCT012, TCT022 and TCT023).

  **Workaround:** Enable the NVS cache by setting the following Kconfig options: :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NVS_LOOKUP_CACHE` to ``y`` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NVS_LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE` to ``512`` (requires additional 2KB of RAM).
  Additional optimization can be enabled by setting the following Kconfig options: :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SETTINGS_NVS_NAME_CACHE` to ``y`` and :kconfig:option:`SETTINGS_NVS_NAME_CACHE_SIZE` to ``512`` (requires additional 2KB of RAM).
  Alternatively, you can manually cherry-pick and apply commit with fix from ``main`` (commit hash: ``216d6588d069390d2c5291560002ca47684fbfc0``).

KRKNWK-13010: Dropping from Thread to Bluetooth LE takes too long
  Dropping from Thread to Bluetooth LE, after a Thread Border Router is powered off, takes much longer for FTD accessories than estimated in TCT030 test case.
  It takes between 3-4 minutes for the FTD accessory to detect that the Thread network connection is lost.
  The accessory then waits the specified 65 seconds and falls back to Bluetooth LE in case the Thread network is not available again.

  **Workaround:** Specification for TCT030 is going to be updated.

KRKNWK-14130: Bluetooth LE TX configuration is set to ``0`` dBm by default
  The minimum Bluetooth LE TX configuration required is at least ``4`` dBm.
  For HomeKit multiprotocol samples, this should be ``8`` dBm.
  This results in a weak signal on the SoC itself.

  **Workaround:** You need to configure the appropriate dBm values for Bluetooth LE and Thread manually in the source code.

KRKNWK-13249: Unexpected assertion in HAP Bluetooth Peripheral Manager
  When Bluetooth LE layer emits callback with a connect or disconnect event, one of its parameters is an underlying Bluetooth LE connection object.
  On rare occasions, this connection object is no longer valid by the time it is processed in HomeKit, and this results in assertion.
  There is no proven workaround yet.

KRKNWK-11729: Stateless switch event characteristic value not handled according to specification in Bluetooth LE mode
  The stateless programmable switch application does not handle the value of the stateless switch event characteristic in the Bluetooth LE mode according to the specification.
  According to the specification, the accessory is expected to return null once the characteristic has been read or after 10 seconds have passed.
  In its current implementation in the |NCS|, the characteristic value does not change to null immediately after it is read, and changes to null after 5 seconds instead.

  **Workaround:** The HomeKit specification in point 11.47 is going to be updated.

SEGGER Embedded Studio Nordic Edition
=====================================

.. note::
    SEGGER Embedded Studio Nordic Edition support has been deprecated with the |NCS| v2.0.0 release and |VSC| is now the default IDE for the |NCS|.
    Use the `Open an existing application <Migrating IDE_>`_ option in the |nRFVSC| to migrate your application.

NCSDK-6852: Extra CMake options might not be applied in version 5.10d
  If you specify :guilabel:`Extra CMake Build Options` in the **Open nRF Connect SDK Project** dialog and at the same time select an **nRF Connect Toolchain Version** of the form ``X.Y.Z``, the additional CMake options are discarded.

  **Workaround:** Select ``NONE (Use SES settings/environment PATH)`` from the :guilabel:`nRF Connect Toolchain Version` drop-down if you want to specify :guilabel:`Extra CMake Build Options`.

NCSDK-8372: Project name collision causes SES Nordic Edition to load the wrong project
  Some samples that are located in different folders use the same project name.
  For example, there is a ``light_switch`` project both in the :file:`samples/bluetooth/mesh/` folder and in the :file:`samples/zigbee/` folder.
  When you select one of these samples from the project list in the **Open nRF Connect SDK Project** dialog, the wrong sample might be selected.
  Check the **Build Directory** field in the dialog to see if this is the case.
  The field indicates the path to the project that SES Nordic Edition will load.

  **Workaround:** If the path in **Build Directory** points to the wrong project, select the correct project by using the :guilabel:`...` button for :guilabel:`Projects` and navigating to the correct project location.
  The build directory will update automatically.

NCSDK-9992: Multiple extra CMake options applied as single option
  If you specify two or more :guilabel:`Extra CMake Build Options` in the **Open nRF Connect SDK Project** dialog, those will be incorrectly treated as one option where the second option becomes a value to the first.
  For example: ``-DFOO=foo -DBAR=bar`` will define the CMake variable ``FOO`` having the value ``foo -DBAR=bar``.

  **Workaround:** Create a CMake preload script containing ``FOO`` and ``BAR`` settings, and then specify ``-C <pre-load-script>.cmake`` in :guilabel:`Extra CMake Build Options`.

Secure Partition Manager (SPM)
==============================

.. note::
    The Secure Partition Manager (SPM) is deprecated as of |NCS| v2.1.0 and removed after |NCS| v2.2.0. It is replaced by :ref:`Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) <ug_tfm>`.

NCSDK-19156: Building SPM for other boards than ``nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp`` and ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160`` fails with compilation error in :file:`cortex_m_systick.c`
  This happens because the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CORTEX_M_SYSTICK` configuration option is enabled while the systick node is disabled in the devicetree.

  **Affected platforms:** nRF9160, nRF5340

  **Workaround:** Enable the systick node in a DTS overlay file for the SPM build by completing the following steps:

  1. Create an overlay file :file:`systick_enabled.overlay` with the following content:

     .. code-block::

        &systick {
          status = "okay";
        };

  #. Add the overlay file as a build argument to SPM:

NCSIDB-114: Default logging causes crash
  Enabling default logging in the Secure Partition Manager sample makes it crash if the sample logs any data after the application has booted (for example, during a SecureFault, or in a secure service).
