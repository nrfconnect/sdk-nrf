Installing the |NCS| from a zip (experimental)
##############################################

.. warning::
   Installing from a zip is not officially supported yet.
   It should work fine for common use cases, but not all scenarios have been tested.

To simplify the |NCS| installation on Windows operating systems, you can download a zip file that contains the full |NCS| toolchain.

The toolchain zip includes the full `GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain`_, the Nordic Edition of |SES|, and all tools that are required to build and program |NCS| applications.
The |NCS| code base must be downloaded separately as part of the installation process.

To install the |NCS| from a zip, download the toolchain zip from INSERTLINK.
Then follow the instructions in the :file:`INSTALL.txt` file to set up your environment.

.. note::
   The toolchain zip is only available for Windows operating systems.
