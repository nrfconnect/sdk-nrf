This guide helps you get started with Thingy:91.
It tells you how to update the Thingy:91 application and modem firmware and connect the Thingy:91 to `nRF Cloud`_.

If you have already set up your Thingy:91 and want to learn more, see the following documentation:

* :ref:`ug_thingy91` for more advanced topics related to the Thingy:91.
* The :ref:`introductory documentation <getting_started>` for more information on the |NCS| and the development environment.

Requirements for setting up the Thingy:91
*****************************************

Make sure you have all the required hardware and that your computer has one of the supported operating systems.

Hardware
========

* nano-Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card that supports LTE-M or Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) (The Thingy:91 comes shipped with an iBasis SIM card.)
* Micro-USB 2.0 cable
* Computer

Software
========

* Microsoft Windows 10
* macOS X, latest version
* Ubuntu Linux, latest Long Term Support (LTS) version

Preparing for setup
*******************

Before you start updating the modem firmware and application on the Thingy:91, you must do some preliminary configurations.

Complete the following steps to prepare the Thingy:91 for setup:

1. Install the `nRF Connect Programmer`_ application on the computer:

   a. Go to `nRF Connect for Desktop Downloads <Download nRF Connect for Desktop_>`_.
   #. Download and install nRF Connect for Desktop.
   #. Open `nRF Connect for Desktop`_.
   #. Find **Programmer** in the list of applications and click :guilabel:`Install`.

.. _download_firmware_thingy91:

2. Download the firmware:

   a. Go to `Thingy:91 product website (downloads)`_.
   #. Download the zip file containing the latest Thingy:91 application and modem firmware.
   #. Extract the zip file to a folder of your choice.

   The :file:`CONTENTS.txt` file in the extracted folder contains the location and names of the different firmware images.


   .. note::
      You can also use these precompiled firmware image files for restoring the firmware to its initial image.

#. Prepare the Thingy:91 hardware:

   a. Open the box and take out the Thingy:91 and the iBasis Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card it comes shipped with.
   #. Plug the Thingy:91 into the computer using a micro-Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable.
   #. Power the Thingy:91 on by switching **SW1** to the **ON** position.

Programming firmware
********************

Thingy:91 (v1.5.0 or lower) comes preloaded with the nRF9160: Asset Tracker firmware and modem firmware on the nRF9160 :term:`System in Package (SiP)`, and the Connectivity bridge application firmware on the nRF52840 :term:`System on Chip (SoC)` that enable the device to use the environment sensors and track the device using :term:`Global Positioning System (GPS)`.
The data is transmitted to nRF Cloud.

Before you start using the Thingy:91, it is recommended that you update the application firmware to :ref:`asset_tracker_v2`.
You must also update the modem firmware.
You can do this through :term:`Universal Serial Bus (USB)` (MCUboot) or an external debug probe by using the Programmer application.

.. note::
   To update the Thingy:91 through USB, the nRF9160 SiP and nRF52840 SoC bootloaders must be factory-compatible.
   The bootloaders might not be factory-compatible if the nRF9160 SiP or nRF52840 SoC has been updated with an external debug probe.
   To restore the bootloaders, program the nRF9160 SiP or nRF52840 SoC with the Thingy:91 firmware files through an external debug probe.


.. note::
   The external debug probe must support Arm Cortex-M33, such as the nRF9160 DK.
   You need a 10-pin 2x5 socket-socket 1.27 mm IDC (:term:`Serial Wire Debug (SWD)`) JTAG cable to connect to the external debug probe.

Following are the three recommended steps when you start to program a Thingy:91:

1. :ref:`Updating the Connectivity bridge application firmware in the nRF52840 SoC <updating_the conn_bridge_52840>`.
#. :ref:`Updating the modem firmware on the nRF9160 SoC (especially if you want to incorporate the latest changes from a newly released modem firmware) <update_modem_fw_nrf9160>`.
#. :ref:`Programming the application firmware on the nRF9160 SiP <update_nrf9160_application>`.


Before you start, make sure the Thingy:91 is connected to the computer with a micro-USB cable.

.. note::

   Do not unplug the Nordic Thingy:91 during this process.

      Inserting SIM

#. Connect the Thingy:91 to the computer with a USB cable and turn it on, or reset the device if it is already turned on.
#. Wait up to three minutes for the Thingy:91 to connect to the LTE network and to nRF Cloud.

   After a few moments, the nRF Cloud user association process starts.
   This is indicated by white double pulse blinking of the Thingy:91's RGB LED as indicated in :ref:`Operating states <led_indication>`.

#. In the Add LTE Device window from Step 4, enter your device ID and ownership code.

   * **Device ID**: The device ID is composed of *nrf-* and the 15-digit :term:`International Mobile (Station) Equipment Identity (IMEI)` number that is printed on the label of your Thingy:91. It is case sensitive, so make sure all the letters are lower-case.
   * **Ownership code**: The ownership code is the PIN or the hardware ID of your Thingy:91, and it is found on the label of your Thingy:91.

   .. figure:: /images/thingy91_pin_imei.svg
      :alt: PIN and IMEI on Thingy:91

   If the label contains a PIN in addition to the IMEI number, enter this pin.
   If it does not contain a PIN, enter the Hardware ID (HWID) HEX code, with or without colons.
   For example, *AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF* or *AABBCCDDEEFF*.

   .. note::

      The ownership code serves as a password and proves that you own the specific Thingy:91.
      Therefore, do not share it with anyone.


#. Click :guilabel:`Add Device`.

   The message "Device added to account. Waiting for it to connect..." appears.

   .. note::

      If you see an error message, check the error code and see `nRF Cloud REST API (v1)`_ to find out what is causing the error.

#. When the message has disappeared, go to the menu on the left and click :guilabel:`Devices`.

   You can see the Thingy:91 in your device list and all the sensor data being transmitted to the cloud from the  Thingy:91.
   The LED on the Thingy:91 should be blinking green, which indicates that it is transmitting all the data to the cloud.

   .. note::

      It might take a while for the sensor data to appear in the nRF Cloud portal, depending on the duration of time GNSS uses to search for a fix.
