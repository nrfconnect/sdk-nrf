To program the :ref:`output build files <app_build_output_files>` to your device, which in most of the cases will be :file:`zephyr.hex` or :file:`merged.hex`, use the steps for the development environment.

.. |exceptions_step| replace:: Make sure you are familiar with :ref:`programming_hw`.

Hardware-specific programming steps
***********************************

Some hardware has platform-specific requirements that must be met before you program the device.
For additional information, check the :ref:`user guide for the hardware platform <device_guides>` that you are using.

For example, if you are working with an nRF9160 DK, you need to select the correct position of the :ref:`board controller <nrf9160_ug_intro>` switch **SW10** before you program the application to your development kit.
Programming to Thingy:91 also requires a :ref:`similar step <building_pgming>`, but using a different switch (**SW2**).

Programming the nRF52840 Dongle
  To program the nRF52840 Dongle instead of a development kit, follow the programming instructions in :ref:`zephyr:nrf52840dongle_nrf52840` or use the `nRF Connect Programmer app <Programming the nRF52840 Dongle_>`_.

.. _programming_params:

Optional programming parameters
*******************************

You can customize the basic ``west flash`` command in a variety of ways.

.. _programming_params_no_erase:

Programming without ``--erase``
  As an alternative to the recommended ``west flash --erase``, you can also clear only those flash memory pages that are to be overwritten with the new application.
  With such approach, the old data in other areas will be retained.

  To erase only the areas of flash memory that are required for programming the new application, use the following command:

  .. code-block:: console

     west flash

Programming with ``--recover``
  Several Nordic Semiconductor SoCs or SiPs supported in the |NCS| offer an implementation of the :term:`Access port protection mechanism (AP-Protect)`, a form of readback protection.
  To disable the AP-Protect, you must recover your device.
  This is particularly important for multi-core devices.

  Use the following command:

  .. code-block:: console

     west flash --recover

  This command uses ``nrfjprog --recover`` command in the background.
  It erases all user available non-volatile memory and disables the readback protection mechanism if enabled.
