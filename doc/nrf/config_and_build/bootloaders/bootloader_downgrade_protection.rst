Downgrade protection
####################

The downgrade protection feature blocks downgrading the firmware version on the device.
This can be useful for security reasons, because firmware downgrade can allow attackers to bring back security vulnerabilities that were fixed by a particular firmware update.

As part of this process, the bootloader compares the new firmware image version with the version of the currently booted firmware.
The bootloader rejects the update if the new image version is lower than the version of the currently booted firmware.

The implementation is related to the :ref:`ug_fw_update_image_versions` and depends on the type of bootloader used:

* Software-based downgrade protection is supported only by MCUboot.
  In this kind of protection, the current firmware version is encoded into the currently active image.
* Hardware-based downgrade protection is supported by both MCUboot and |NSIB|.
  In this kind of protection, the current version is encoded into a non-volatile storage partition outside of any image.

Software-based downgrade protection
***********************************

The |NCS| supports MCUboot's software-based downgrade prevention for application images, using semantic versioning.
This feature offers protection against any outdated firmware that is uploaded to a device.

To enable this feature, set the configuration option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION` for the MCUboot image and ``SB_CONFIG_MCUBOOT_MODE_OVERWRITE_ONLY`` for sysbuild.

.. caution::
   Enabling ``SB_CONFIG_MCUBOOT_MODE_OVERWRITE_ONLY`` prevents the fallback recovery of application images.
   Consult its Kconfig description and the :doc:`MCUboot Design documentation <mcuboot:design>` for more information on how to use it.

   For nRF53 Series devices, this mode is generally the most appropriate for MCUboot.
   The default mode applies only to the application core and not the network core, potentially resulting in a version mismatch.

   In such cases, the application could roll back to a previous working version, but the network core would remain unchanged, leading to inconsistencies.
   If the network core remains compatible with an updated version, these issues may go unnoticed for an extended period, making them difficult to debug.

You can compile your application with this feature as follows:

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   west build -b *board_target* *application* -- \\
   -DSB_CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y \\
   -DSB_CONFIG_MCUBOOT_MODE_OVERWRITE_ONLY=y \\
   -DCONFIG_MCUBOOT_IMGTOOL_SIGN_VERSION=\\"0.1.2\\+3\\" \\
   -Dmcuboot_CONFIG_MCUBOOT_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION=y

|how_to_configure|

After you upload a new image and reset the development kit, MCUboot attempts to boot the secondary image.
If this image has, in order of precedence, a *major*, *minor*, or *revision* value that is lower than the primary application image, it is considered invalid and the existing primary application boots instead.

.. note::
   By default, the optional label or build number specified after the ``+`` character is ignored when evaluating the version.
   For example, an existing application image with version ``0.1.2+3`` can be overwritten by an uploaded image with ``0.1.2+2``, but not by one with ``0.1.1+2``.
   Checking against this field can be performed by enabling :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOT_VERSION_CMP_USE_BUILD_NUMBER` in the MCUboot image

.. _bootloader_monotonic_counter:

Hardware-based downgrade protection
***********************************

.. bootloader_monotonic_counter_start

You can implement hardware-based downgrade protection using a non-volatile monotonic counter.

Counter updates are written to slots in the *Provision* area, with each new counter update occupying a new slot.
For this reason, the number of counter updates, and therefore firmware version updates, is limited.
The *Provision* is a partition in non-volatile memory, and its location can be found using :ref:`pm_generated_output_and_usage_pm_report`.

Using a counter is optional and can be configured for the application using configuration options.
You can also configure the supported number of updates, but the number is limited by the size of the *Provision* area and how much of that area is taken up by other features, like public key hashes.
In addition, you can configure what firmware version of the image you want to boot.

Downgrade protection using |NSIB|
=================================

.. bootloader_monotonic_counter_nsib_start

To enable anti-rollback protection with monotonic counter for |NSIB|, set the following configurations in the ``b0`` image: :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SB_MONOTONIC_COUNTER` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SB_NUM_VER_COUNTER_SLOTS`

Special handling is needed when updating the S1 variant of an image when :ref:`ug_bootloader_adding_upgradable`.
See :ref:`ug_bootloader_adding_presigned_variants` for details.
See :ref:`zephyr:sysbuild_kconfig_namespacing` for information on how to set options for built images in Sysbuild.

To set options for other images, see :ref:`zephyr:sysbuild_kconfig_namespacing`.

.. _ug_fw_update_hw_downgrade_mcuboot:

Downgrade protection using MCUboot
==================================

To enable anti-rollback protection with monotonic counter for MCUboot, set the following configurations using sysbuild:

* ``SB_CONFIG_MCUBOOT_HARDWARE_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION``
* ``SB_CONFIG_MCUBOOT_HW_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION_COUNTER_SLOTS``
* ``SB_CONFIG_MCUBOOT_HW_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION_COUNTER_VALUE``
