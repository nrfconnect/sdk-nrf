Nordic Thingy:91 is a battery-operated prototyping platform for cellular IoT systems, designed especially for asset tracking applications and environmental monitoring.

Thingy:91 integrates the following components:

* nRF9160 SiP - supporting LTE-M, NB-IoT, and Global Positioning System (GPS)
* nRF52840 SoC - supporting Bluetooth Low Energy and Near Field Communication (NFC)

You can find more information on the product in the `Thingy:91 product page`_ and in the `Nordic Thingy:91 User Guide`_.
The |NCS| provides support for developing applications on the Thingy:91.

.. _thingy91_serialports:

Connecting to Thingy:91 serial ports
************************************

For connecting to Thingy:91, you can use LTE Link Monitor, Trace Collector applications, or a serial terminal.
In the case of LTE Link Monitor or Trace Collector applications, the baud rate for the communication is set automatically.

If you prefer to use a standard serial terminal, the baud rate has to be specified manually.

Thingy:91 uses the following UART baud rate configuration:

Firmware
********

The firmware of Thingy:91 has been developed using the nRF Connect SDK.
It is open source, and can be modified according to specific needs.
The :ref:`asset_tracker` application firmware, which is preprogrammed in the Thingy:91, enables the device to use the environment sensors and provides an option of tracking the device using GPS.

The data, along with information about the device, is transmitted to Nordic Semiconductor's cloud solution, `nRF Connect for Cloud`_, where it can be visualized.
See :ref:`asset_tracker` for more information on the asset tracker application.

Operating modes
===============

Thingy:91 contains RGB indicator LEDs, which indicate the operating state of the device as described in :ref:`operating states of Thingy:91<thingy91_operating_states>`.

GPS
===

Thingy:91 has GPS, which, if activated, allows the device to be located globally using GPS signals.
To activate GPS, long-press the SW3 button.
See :ref:`Button SW3 on Thingy:91<asset_tracker_user_interface>` for information.

LTE Band Lock
=============

The modem within Thingy:91 can be configured to use specific LTE bands by using the band lock AT command.
See :ref:`nrf9160_ug_band_lock` and the `band lock section in the AT Commands reference document`_ for additional information.
The preprogrammed firmware configures the modem to use the bands currently certified on the Thingy:91 hardware.
When building the firmware, you can configure which bands should be enabled.

LTE-M / NB-IoT switching
========================

Thingy:91 has a multimode modem, which enables it to support automatic switching between LTE-M and NB-IoT.
A built-in parameter in the Thingy:91 firmware determines whether the modem first attempts to connect in LTE-M or NB-IoT mode.
If the modem fails to connect using this preferred mode within the default time-out period (10 minutes), the modem switches to the other mode.

Modem firmware
==============

The functionality of the multimode modem of Thingy:91 is based on its firmware, which is available as a precompiled binary.
You can download the modem firmware from the `Thingy:91 product website (downloads)`_.
The downloadable zip file contains both the full firmware images that can be programmed using an external debug probe and the firmware images that can be used for updating the firmware through the built-in bootloader.

.. _precompiled_fw:

Programming precompiled firmware images
****************************************

Precompiled firmware image files are useful in the following scenarios:

* Restoring the firmware to its initial image

* Updating the application firmware to a newly released version

* Updating the modem firmware

Downloading precompiled firmware images
========================================

To obtain precompiled firmware images for updating the firmware, perform the following steps:

	1. Go to the `Thingy:91 product page`_ and under the :guilabel:`Downloads` tab, navigate to :guilabel:`Precompiled firmware`.
	#. Download and extract the latest Thingy:91 firmware package.
	#. Check the :file:`CONTENTS.txt` file in the extracted folder for the location and names of the different firmware images.

.. _programming_usb:

Quick programming of precompiled firmware images
=================================================

When you have the precompiled firmware images ready, you can directly program the images onto the Thingy:91 using the `nRF Connect Programmer`_ app, which is available in `nRF Connect for Desktop`_.

In this method, the Thingy:91 is connected directly to your PC through USB.
This method makes use of the :doc:`mcuboot:index` feature and the inbuilt serial recovery mode of Thingy:91.
You can program either the nRF9160 SiP or the nRF52840 SoC component on the Thingy:91.

Alternatively, you can use an external debug probe such as nRF9160 DK or any J-Link device supporting ARM Cortex-M33 to program applications on a Thingy:91.

See `Programming applications on Nordic Thingy:91`_ for the detailed procedures to program a Thingy:91 using nRF Connect Programmer.

Updating the modem firmware
===========================

You can update the modem firmware of Thingy:91 using any of the following methods:

* Using USB (MCUboot)
* Using an external debug probe such as nRF9160 DK or any J-Link device supporting ARM Cortex-M33

See `Programming the Thingy:91 modem`_ for the detailed steps to update the modem firmware.

.. _building_pgming:

Building and programming from the source code
*********************************************

You can also program the Thingy:91 by using the images obtained by building the code in an |NCS| environment.

To set up your system to be able to build a compatible firmware image, follow the :ref:`getting_started` guide for |NCS|.
The build targets of interest for Thingy:91 in |NCS| are as follows:

+---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|Component      |  Build target                                    |
+===============+==================================================+
|nRF9160 SiP    |``thingy91_nrf9160`` for the secure version       |
|               |                                                  |
|               |``thingy91_nrf9160ns`` for the non-secure version |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|nRF52840 SoC   |``thingy91_nrf52840``                             |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------+

You should use the build target ``thingy91_nrf9160`` or ``thingy91_nrf9160ns`` when building the application code for the nRF9160 SiP and the build target ``thingy91_nrf52840`` when building the application code for the onboard nRF52840 SoC.

.. note::

   In |NCS| releases before v1.3.0, these build targets were named ``nrf9160_pca20035``, ``nrf9160_pca20035ns``, and ``nrf52840_pca20035``.

.. note::

   LTE/GPS features can only be used with non-secure target.

The table below shows the different types of build files that are generated and the different scenarios in which they are used:

+--------------+----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

There are multiple methods of programming a sample or application onto a Thingy:91.
You can choose the method based on the availability or absence of an external debug probe to program.

.. note::

   If you do not have an external debug probe available to program the Thingy:91, you can directly program by :ref:`using the USB (MCUboot) method and nRF Connect Programmer<programming_usb>`.
   In this scenario, use the :file:`app_signed.hex` firmware image file.

Building and programming on the command line
============================================

Complete the :ref:`command-line build setup <build_environment_cli>` before you start building |NCS| projects on the command line.

To build and program the source code from the command line, complete the following steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
#. Go to the specific sample or application directory.
   For example, the folder path is ``ncs/nrf/applications/asset_tracker`` when building the source code for the :ref:`asset_tracker` application on the nRF9160 SiP component and ``ncs/nrf/applications/connectivity_bridge`` when building the source code for the :ref:`connectivity_bridge` application on the nRF52840 SoC component.

#. Make sure that you have the required version of the |NCS| repository by pulling the |NCS| repository, `sdk-nrf`_ on GitHub using the procedures described in :ref:`dm-wf-get-ncs` and :ref:`dm-wf-update-ncs`.

#. To get the rest of the dependencies, run the ``west update`` command as follows:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      west update

#. To build the sample or application code, run the ``west build`` command as follows:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

	  west build -b *build_target* -d *destination_directory_name*

   The parameter *build_target* should be ``thingy91_nrf9160`` or ``thingy91_nrf9160ns`` if building for the nRF9160 SiP component and ``thingy91_nrf52840`` if building for the nRF52840 SoC component.

   .. note::

	  The parameter *destination_directory_name* can be used to optionally specify the destination directory in the west command.
	  Unless a *destination_directory_name* is specified, the build files are automatically generated in ``build/zephyr/``.

.. include:: ug_thingy91.rst
   :start-after: prog_extdebugprobe_start
   :end-before: prog_extdebugprobe_end
..

   e. Program the sample or application to the device using the following command:

      .. code-block:: console

       west flash

   #. The device will reset and run the programmed sample or application.
