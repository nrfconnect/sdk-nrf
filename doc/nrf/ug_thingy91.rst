Nordic Thingy:91 is a battery-operated prototyping platform for cellular IoT systems, designed especially for asset tracking applications and environmental monitoring.
Thingy:91 integrates an nRF9160 SiP that supports LTE-M, NB-IoT, and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and an nRF52840 SoC that supports BluetoothÂ® Low Energy, Near Field Communication (NFC) and USB.

You can find more information on the product in the `Thingy:91 product page`_ and in the `Nordic Thingy:91 User Guide`_.
The |NCS| provides support for developing applications on the Thingy:91.
If you are not familiar with the |NCS| and the development environment, see the :ref:`introductory documentation <getting_started>`.

This guide gives you more information on the various aspects of Thingy:91.

.. _thingy91_serialports:

Connecting to Thingy:91
***********************

For connecting to Thingy:91, you can use `LTE Link Monitor`_, `Trace Collector`_, or a serial terminal.

Using serial ports
==================

If you prefer to use a standard serial terminal, the baud rate has to be specified manually.

Thingy:91 uses the following UART baud rate configuration:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: center

   * - UART Interface
     - Baud Rate
   * - UART_0
     - 115200
   * - UART_1
     - 1000000


Using LTE Link Monitor
======================

You can use the `LTE Link Monitor`_ application to get debug output and send AT commands to the Thingy:91.
In the case of LTE Link Monitor or Trace Collector, the baud rate for the communication is set automatically.

To connect to the Thingy:91 using LTE Link Monitor, complete the following steps:

1. Open `nRF Connect for Desktop`_.
#. Find LTE Link Monitor in the list of applications and click :guilabel:`Install`.
#. Connect the Thingy:91 to a computer with a micro-Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable.
#. Make sure that the Thingy:91 is powered on.
#. Launch the LTE Link Monitor application.
#. In the navigation bar, click :guilabel:`Select device`.
   A drop-down menu appears.
#. In the menu, select Thingy:91.
#. In the LTE Link Monitor terminal, send an AT command to the modem.
   If the connection is working, the modem responds with OK.

The terminal view shows all of the Asset Tracker v2 debug output as well as the AT commands and their results.
For information on the available AT commands, see `nRF91 AT Commands Reference Guide <AT Commands Reference Guide_>`_.


Operating modes
***************

Thingy:91 contains RGB indicator LEDs, which indicate the operating state of the device as described in the :ref:`LED indication <led_indication>` section of the :ref:`asset_tracker_v2_ui_module`.

GNSS
****

Thingy:91 has a GNSS receiver, which, if activated, allows the device to be located globally using GNSS signals.
In :ref:`asset_tracker_v2`, GNSS is activated by default.

LTE Band Lock
*************

The modem within Thingy:91 can be configured to use specific LTE bands by using the band lock AT command.
See :ref:`nrf9160_ug_band_lock` and the `band lock section in the AT Commands reference document`_ for additional information.
The preprogrammed firmware configures the modem to use the bands currently certified on the Thingy:91 hardware.
When building the firmware, you can configure which bands should be enabled.

LTE-M / NB-IoT switching
************************

Thingy:91 has a multimode modem, which enables it to support automatic switching between LTE-M and NB-IoT.
A built-in parameter in the Thingy:91 firmware determines whether the modem first attempts to connect in LTE-M or NB-IoT mode.
If the modem fails to connect using this preferred mode within the default timeout period (10 minutes), the modem switches to the other mode.

.. _building_pgming:

Building and programming from the source code
*********************************************

You can also program the Thingy:91 by using the images obtained by building the code in an |NCS| environment.

To set up your system to be able to build a compatible firmware image, follow the :ref:`getting_started` guide for |NCS|.
The build targets of interest for Thingy:91 in |NCS| are as follows:

+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
|Component      |  Build target                                     |
+===============+===================================================+
|nRF9160 SiP    |``thingy91_nrf9160`` for the secure version        |
|               |                                                   |
|               |``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` for the non-secure version |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
|nRF52840 SoC   |``thingy91_nrf52840``                              |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+

You must use the build target ``thingy91_nrf9160`` or ``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` when building the application code for the nRF9160 SiP and the build target ``thingy91_nrf52840`` when building the application code for the onboard nRF52840 SoC.

.. note::

   * In |NCS| releases before v1.3.0, these build targets were named ``nrf9160_pca20035``, ``nrf9160_pca20035ns``, and ``nrf52840_pca20035``.
   * In |NCS| releases ranging from v1.3.0 to v1.6.1, the build target ``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` was named ``thingy91_nrf9160ns``.

.. note::

   LTE/GNSS features can only be used with non-secure target.

The table below shows the different types of build files that are generated and the different scenarios in which they are used:

+--------------+----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

There are multiple methods of programming a sample or application onto a Thingy:91.
You can choose the method based on the availability or absence of an external debug probe to program.

.. note::

   If you do not have an external debug probe available to program the Thingy:91, you can directly program by :ref:`using the USB (MCUboot) method and nRF Connect Programmer <programming_usb>`.
   In this scenario, use the :file:`app_signed.hex` firmware image file.

.. note::

   While building applications for Thingy:91, the build system changes the signing algorithm of MCUboot so that it uses the default RSA Keys.
   This is to ensure backward compatibility with the MCUboot versions that precede the |NCS| v1.4.0.
   The default RSA keys must only be used for development.
   In a final product, you must use your own, secret keys.
   See :ref:`ug_fw_update_development_keys` for more information.

.. _build_pgm_cmdline:

Building and programming on the command line
============================================

Complete the :ref:`command-line build setup <build_environment_cli>` before you start building |NCS| projects on the command line.

To build and program the source code from the command line, complete the following steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
#. Go to the specific sample or application directory.
   For example, the folder path is ``ncs/nrf/applications/asset_tracker_v2`` when building the source code for the :ref:`asset_tracker_v2` application on the nRF9160 SiP component and ``ncs/nrf/applications/connectivity_bridge`` when building the source code for the :ref:`connectivity_bridge` application on the nRF52840 SoC component.

#. Make sure that you have the required version of the |NCS| repository by pulling the |NCS| repository, `sdk-nrf`_ on GitHub using the procedures described in :ref:`dm-wf-get-ncs` and :ref:`dm-wf-update-ncs`.

#. To get the rest of the dependencies, run the ``west update`` command as follows:

   .. code-block:: console

      west update

#. To build the sample or application code, run the ``west build`` command as follows:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      west build -b *build_target* -d *destination_directory_name*

   The parameter *build_target* should be ``thingy91_nrf9160`` or ``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` if building for the nRF9160 SiP component and ``thingy91_nrf52840`` if building for the nRF52840 SoC component.

   .. note::

	   The parameter *destination_directory_name* can be used to optionally specify the destination directory in the west command.
	   Unless a *destination_directory_name* is specified, the build files are automatically generated in ``build/zephyr/``.

.. include:: ug_thingy91.rst
   :start-after: prog_extdebugprobe_start
   :end-before: prog_extdebugprobe_end
..

   e. Program the sample or application to the device using the following command:

      .. code-block:: console

       west flash

      The device will reset and run the programmed sample or application.
