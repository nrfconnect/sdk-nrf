Running applications with Trusted Firmware-M

On nRF5340 and nRF9160, you can use Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) as an alternative to :ref:`secure_partition_manager` for running an application from the non-secure area of the memory.

Overview
********

TF-M is the reference implementation of `Platform Security Architecture (PSA)`_.

It provides a highly configurable set of software components to create a Trusted Execution Environment.
This is achieved by a set of secure run time services such as Secure Storage, Cryptography, Audit Logs, and Attestation.
Additionally, secure boot through MCUboot in TF-M ensures integrity of run time software and supports firmware upgrade.

Support for TF-M in |NCS| is currently experimental.
TF-M is a framework which will be extended for new functions and use cases beyond the scope of SPM.

For official documentation, see the `TF-M documentation`_.

The TF-M implementation in |NCS| is currently demonstrated in the following samples:

- The :ref:`tfm_hello_world` sample
- All :ref:`cryptography samples <crypto_samples>` in this SDK
- A series of :ref:`TF-M integration samples <zephyr:tfm_integration-samples>` available in Zephyr
- The :ref:`https_client` sample for nRF9160 in this SDK
- The :ref:`openthread_samples` that support the ``nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp_ns`` build target in this SDK

Building
********

TF-M is one of the images that are built as part of a multi-image application.
If TF-M is used in the application, SPM will not be included in it.
For more information about multi-image builds, see :ref:`ug_multi_image`.

To add TF-M to your build, enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BUILD_WITH_TFM` configuration option by adding it to your :file:`prj.conf` file.
To build a :ref:`minimal version <tfm_minimal_build>` of TF-M, you must also enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_MINIMAL` configuration.

.. note::
   If you use menuconfig to enable :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BUILD_WITH_TFM`, you must also enable its dependencies.

You must build TF-M using a non-secure build target.
The following targets are currently supported:

* ``nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp_ns``
* ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns``

When building for ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns``, UART1 must be disabled in the non-secure application, because it is used by the TF-M secure application.
Otherwise, the non-secure application will fail to run.
The recommended way to do this is to copy the .overlay file from the :ref:`tfm_hello_world` sample.

Enabling secure services
========================

When using the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_security`, if :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BUILD_WITH_TFM` is enabled together with :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NORDIC_SECURITY_BACKEND`, the TF-M secure image will enable the use of the hardware acceleration of Arm CryptoCell.
In such case, the Kconfig configurations in the Nordic Security Backend control the features enabled through TF-M.

You can configure what crypto modules to include in TF-M by using the ``TFM_CRYPTO_`` Kconfig options found in file :file:`zephyr/modules/trusted-firmware-m/Kconfig.tfm.crypto_modules`.

TF-M utilizes :ref:`hardware unique keys <lib_hw_unique_key>` when the PSA Crypto key derivation APIs are used, and ``psa_key_derivation_setup`` is called with the algorithm ``TFM_CRYPTO_ALG_HUK_DERIVATION``.

.. _tfm_minimal_build:

Minimal build
=============

The default configuration of TF-M has all supported features enabled, which results in a significant memory footprint.
A minimal version of the TF-M secure application is provided in |NCS| to show how to configure a reduced version of TF-M.

The secure services supported by this minimal version allow for generating random numbers, hashing with SHA-256, and using ``tfm_platform_mem_read``.
This corresponds to the feature set provided by the :ref:`secure_partition_manager`.


The minimal version of TF-M is enabled by setting the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_MINIMAL` option.

When :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_MINIMAL` is set, the configurability of TF-M is severely limited.
Hence, it is not possible to modify the TF-M minimal configuration to create your own variant of the minimal configuration.
Instead, the default configuration must be used as a starting point.

Programming
***********

The procedure for programming an application with TF-M is the same as for other multi-image applications in |NCS|.

After building the application, a :file:`merged.hex` file is created that contains MCUboot, TF-M, and the application.
The :file:`merged.hex` file can be then :ref:`programmed using SES <gs_programming_ses>`.
When using the command line, the file is programmed automatically when you call ``ninja flash`` or ``west flash``.

Logging
*******

TF-M employs two UART interfaces for logging: one for the secure part (MCUboot and TF-M), and one for the non-secure application.
The logs arrive on different COM ports on the host PC.

.. note::
   * On the nRF5340 DK v1.0.0, you must connect specific wires on the kit to receive secure logs on the host PC.
     Specifically, wire the pins **P0.25** and **P0.26** of the **P2** connector respectively to **RxD** and **TxD**  of the **P24** connector.
     See :ref:`logging_cpunet` on the Working with nRF5340 DK page for more information.
   * On the nRF5340 DK v2.0.0, there is one fewer COM port than on v1.0.0, so the secure and non-secure UART peripheral must be wired to the same pins.
     Specifically, wire the pins **P0.25** and **P0.26** to **P0.20** and **P0.22**, respectively.

Limitations
***********

Application code that uses SPM :ref:`lib_secure_services` cannot use TF-M because the interface to TF-M is different and, at this time, not all SPM functions are available in TF-M.
