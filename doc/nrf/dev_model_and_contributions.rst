The |NCS| follows a development model that gives users access to both stable releases and new features that are still under development.

The |NCS| is an SDK that is openly developed and maintained by Nordic Semiconductor.
It is based both on code developed by Nordic Semiconductor engineers and on open-source software projects, which in turn are developed collaboratively by many contributors.

Users can continuously track the development progress of the |NCS| and even :ref:`contribute to it <contributions_ncs>`.
This includes both the Nordic-specific and the open-source portions of the SDK.
