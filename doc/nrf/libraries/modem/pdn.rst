The PDN library can be used to manage Packet Data Protocol (PDP) contexts and PDN connections.
It provides an API for the following purposes:

* Creating and configuring PDP contexts
* Receiving events pertaining to the PDN connections
* Managing PDN connections

The library uses several AT commands, and it relies on the following two types of AT notifications to work:

* Packet domain events notifications (``+CGEV``) - Subscribed by using the `AT+CGEREP set command`_ (``AT+CGEREP=1``)
* Notifications for unsolicited reporting of error codes sent by the network (``+CNEC``) - Subscribed by using the `AT+CNEC set command`_ (``AT+CNEC=16``)

.. note::
   The application must subscribe to the AT notifications for packet domain events and unsolicited reporting of error codes manually.

Following are the AT commands that are used by the library:

* ``AT%XNEWCID`` - To create a PDP context
* ``AT+CGDCONT`` - To configure or destroy a PDP context
* ``AT+CGACT`` - To activate or deactivate a PDN connection
* ``AT%XGETPDNID``- To retrieve the PDN ID for a given PDP context
* ``AT+CGAUTH`` - To set the PDN connection authentication parameters

For more information about these commands, see `Packet Domain AT commands`_.

The application can create PDP contexts by using the :c:func:`pdn_ctx_create` function, and a callback can be assigned to receive the events pertaining to the state and connectivity of the PDP contexts.
The :c:func:`pdn_ctx_configure` function is used to configure a PDP Context, which can be configured with a family, access point name, and optional authentication parameters.
The :c:func:`pdn_activate` function activates a PDN connection for a PDP context.
A PDN connection is identified by an ID as reported by ``AT%XGETPDNID``, and it is distinct from the PDP context ID (CID).
The modem creates a PDN connection for a PDP context as necessary.
Multiple PDP contexts might share the same PDN connection if they are configured similarly.

Configuration
*************

The PDN library overrides the default PDP context configuration during initialization (:c:func:`pdn_init`) if you have set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PDN_DEFAULTS_OVERRIDE` Kconfig option.
The default PDP context configuration consists of the following parameters, each controlled with a Kconfig setting:

* Access point name, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PDN_DEFAULT_APN`
* Family, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PDN_DEFAULT_FAM`
* Authentication method, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PDN_DEFAULT_AUTH`
* Authentication credentials, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PDN_DEFAULT_USERNAME` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PDN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`

.. note::
   The default PDP context configuration must be overridden before the device is registered with the network.

Limitations
***********

You have to set the callback for the default PDP context before the device is registered to the network (``CFUN=1``) to receive the first activation event.
