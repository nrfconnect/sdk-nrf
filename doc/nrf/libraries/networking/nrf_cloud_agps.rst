The nRF Cloud A-GPS library enables applications to request and process Assisted GPS (`A-GPS`_) data from `nRF Cloud`_ to be used with the nRF9160 SiP.
This library is an enhancement to the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library.

The use of A-GPS reduces the time for a GNSS module to estimate its position, which is also called Time to First Fix (TTFF).
To get a position fix, a GNSS module needs information such as the satellite orbital data, exact timing data, and a rough position estimate.
GPS satellites broadcast this information in a pattern, which repeats every 12.5 minutes.
If nRF Cloud A-GPS service is used, the broadcasted information can be downloaded at a faster rate from nRF Cloud.

.. note::
   To use the nRF Cloud A-GPS service, an nRF Cloud account is needed, and the device needs to be associated with a user's account.

Configuration
*************

Configure the following options to enable or disable the use of this library:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_AGPS`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_MQTT` or :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_REST`

See :ref:`configure_application` for information on how to change configuration options.

Request and process A-GPS data
******************************

A-GPS data can be requested using one of the following methods:

* By specifying an array of A-GPS types
* By requesting all the available assistance data

If :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_MQTT` is enabled, the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_agps_request` function is used to request by type, and the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_agps_request_all` function is used to return all available assistance data.
If :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_REST` is enabled, the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_rest_agps_data_get` function is used to request A-GPS data.

When nRF Cloud responds with the requested A-GPS data, the :c:func:`nrf_cloud_agps_process` function processes the received data.
The function parses the data and passes it on to the modem.

Optimizing cloud data downloads
*******************************

When the application only requires a fast GNSS fix at most once per 2 hour period, it can reduce LTE data charges by enabling :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_AGPS_FILTERED` (A-GPS filtered mode).
This option causes nRF Cloud to send ephemerides data for only those satellites whose elevation is at or above the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_AGPS_ELEVATION_MASK` angle at the current moment.

When using the A-GPS filtered mode with the GNSS unit in periodic tracking mode, applications should disable scheduled downloads in the GNSS unit.
Applications do this when initializing the GNSS unit by bitwise ORing the :c:enumerator:`NRF_MODEM_GNSS_USE_CASE_SCHED_DOWNLOAD_DISABLE` bitmask with any other needed use case values, then passing the resulting value to the :c:func:`nrf_modem_gnss_use_case_set` function.
This ensures the GNSS unit does not stay on longer than needed due to the lack of a full set of ephemerides.

When the application requires fast GNSS fixes multiple times within a 2 hour period, it can avoid unnecessary A-GPS data downloads from nRF Cloud by keeping :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_AGPS_FILTERED` disabled.

Practical considerations
************************

The type of assistance data needed at a certain point of time may vary.
Since the library requests only partial data, data traffic reduction and battery conservation might be observed.
The duration for which a particular type of assistance data is valid is different for each type of assistance data.
As an example, `Almanac`_ data has a far longer validity (several months) than `Ephemeris`_ data (2 to 4 hours).

Since the library receives a partial assistance data set, it may cause GNSS to download the missing data from satellites.

When A-GPS data is downloaded using LTE network, the LTE link is in `RRC connected mode <RRC idle mode_>`_.
The GNSS module can only operate when the device is in RRC idle mode or `Power Saving Mode (PSM)`_.
The time to go from RRC connected mode to RRC idle mode is network-dependent.
This time is usually not controlled by the device and is typically in the range of 5 to 70 seconds.
If the GNSS module has already started before the device enters the RRC idle mode, this RRC inactivity may make TTFF appear longer than the actual time spent searching for the GNSS satellite signals.

Limitation
**********

.. agpslimitation_start

Approximate location assistance data is based on LTE cell location.
Not all cell locations are always available.
If they are not available, the location data will be absent in the A-GPS response.
