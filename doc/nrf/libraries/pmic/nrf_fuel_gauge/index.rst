nRF Fuel Gauge processes battery measurements made by Power Management ICs (PMICs) and provides a state-of-charge (SOC) prediction, along with other metrics.
The library is meant for use with devices from the Nordic nPM Family of PMICs.
For the most accurate results, use a battery model that matches the battery used in the product.
A battery model can be derived using the nPM Powerup App in `nRF Connect for Desktop`_ and `nPM1300 Evaluation Kit`_.

See :ref:`fuel_gauge_api` for detailed usage.
