Bluetooth Mesh libraries
########################

BluetoothÂ® Mesh is supported for development in the |NCS|, through the Zephyr :ref:`zephyr:bluetooth_mesh` implementation.
Nordic Semiconductor's implementation of the Bluetooth Mesh protocol allows applications to use the features provided by the Bluetooth Mesh when running on supported Nordic devices.

The `Bluetooth Mesh protocol specification`_ is developed and published by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG).
See the :ref:`Bluetooth Mesh user guide <ug_bt_mesh>` for an overview of the technology, like supported features, concepts and architecture.

The end-user applications (such as Luminaire control) are defined with the help of client-server Bluetooth Mesh models defined in the `Bluetooth Mesh model specification`_.
The Bluetooth Mesh libraries contain modules, including the Bluetooth Mesh models, provided by Nordic Semiconductor to aid in the development of Bluetooth Mesh-based applications.
They implement default behavior of a Bluetooth Mesh device, and are used in :ref:`bt_mesh_samples`.

For information on how to configure and use the supplied libraries for Bluetooth Mesh, see :ref:`ug_bt_mesh_configuring`.

Information about the changes and known issues for Bluetooth Mesh in each release can be found in the |NCS|'s :ref:`release_notes` and on the :ref:`known_issues` page.
