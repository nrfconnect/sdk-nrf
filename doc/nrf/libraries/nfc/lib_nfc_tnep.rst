Tag NDEF Exchange Protocol (TNEP)
#################################

The Tag NDEF Exchange Protocol (TNEP) supports the bidirectional exchange of NDEF messages between a polling (reader) device and an NFC tag.

See the :ref:`ug_nfc` user guide for more information about :ref:`ug_nfc_tnep`.

The |NCS| provides libraries to implement TNEP for both the polling device and the tag:
