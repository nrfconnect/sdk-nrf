Every released version of the LwM2M carrier library is considered for certification with applicable carriers.
The LwM2M carrier library is certified together with specific versions of the modem firmware and the |NCS|.

For a list of all the carrier certifications (including those certifications with no dependency on the LwM2M carrier library), see the `Mobile network operator certifications`_.

The LwM2M carrier library is used by Nordic during *module certification*.
Including the library in your application is one way to fulfill the device management requirements of your carrier.
Note that some carriers accept different approaches for *end product certification*.
For more information, see the device certification programs of your respective carrier:

 * `T-Mobile's IoT certification program`_
 * `Verizon's Get certified program`_
 * `LG U+ certification program`_
