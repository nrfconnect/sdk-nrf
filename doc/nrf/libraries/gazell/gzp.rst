The Gazell pairing library enables applications to use the Gazell Link Layer to provide a secure wireless link between Gazell nodes.
The library is customized for pairing a device (for example, a mouse, keyboard, or remote control) with a host (typically a USB dongle) using Gazell.

See the :ref:`ug_gzp` user guide for more information.

This library is used in the :ref:`gzp_dynamic_pairing` sample.
