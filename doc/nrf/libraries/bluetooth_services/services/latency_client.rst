The Latency Client can be used to interact with a connected peer that is running the Latency service with the :ref:`latency_readme`.
It writes data to the Latency characteristic and waits for a response to count the time spent of a GATT Write operation.

Latency Characteristic
**********************

To request latency data from the Latency Characteristic, use the :c:func:`bt_latency_request` function.
The request sending procedure is asynchronous, so the request data to be sent must remain valid until a dedicated callback notifies you that the Write Request has been completed.
