This module implements a Bluetooth® GATT service for Wi-Fi® provisioning.
This library is to be used with the :ref:`wifi_provisioning` sample.
The Wi-Fi Provisioning Service forms a complete reference solution, together with the mobile application.
You can find details in the documentation of the :ref:`wifi_provisioning` sample.

Overview
********

The service is divided into three parts:

* GATT service interface: Defines GATT service and provides an interface for the configurator to exchange messages.
* Task and event handling component: Handles provisioning-related tasks and events.
* Configuration management component: Manages the provisioning data (in RAM and flash) accessed by multiple threads.

Service declaration

The purpose of each characteristic is as follows:

* ``Information``: For client to get ``Info`` message from server.
* ``Operation Control Point``: For client to send ``Request`` message to server, and server to send ``Response`` message to client.
* ``Data Out``: For server to send ``Result`` message to the client.

Task and event handling
***********************

The Wi-Fi Provisioning Service uses `Protocol Buffers`_ to define platform-independent message formats.
These definitions are available as :file:`.proto` files in the code.

The service also uses `nanopb`_ to convert encoded platform-independent messages to and from C language.

The device performs actions according to messages it exchanges with a configurator (the peer that sends the message, such as a smartphone running the nRF Wi-Fi Provisioner app listed in :ref:`wifi_provisioning_app`).

.. _wifi_provisioning_message_types:

Message types
=============

The service uses four message types:

* ``Info``: Allows the configurator to know the capability of a device before the provisioning process happens.

  The configurator reads this message before sending any other messages.
  The info message contains a ``version`` field.

* ``Request``: Contains a command and configuration.

  The device takes action based on the command and applies the configuration if one is given.

  The following table details the five commands that the service uses.

   =================== ================================================ =============================
   Command             Description                                      Notes
   =================== ================================================ =============================
   GET_STATUS          Get the status of the device, such as
                       provisioning state, Wi-Fi connection state,
                       and more
   START_SCAN          Trigger an access point (AP) scan                ``scan_params`` is optional
   STOP_SCAN           Stop AP scan
   SET_CONFIG          Store Wi-Fi configuration and connect to an AP   ``config`` is required
   FORGET_CONFIG       Erase the configuration and disconnect
   =================== ================================================ =============================

* ``Response``: Contains the command to which it is responding, the operation result, and any other data.

  The device sends any additional data associated with this command to the configurator in a ``Result`` message.

  The ``Response`` message contains one of following response codes:

  * ``SUCCESS``: The operation is dispatched successfully.
  * ``INVALID_ARGUMENT``: The argument is invalid.
  * ``INVALID_PROTO``: The message cannot be encoded or decoded.
  * ``INTERNAL_ERROR``: The operation cannot be dispatched properly.

  If the command is ``GET_STATUS``, the response includes some or all of the following fields:

  * ``state``: Describes the Wi-Fi connection state according to values defined in the :file:`common.proto` file.
  * ``provisioning_info``: Includes Wi-Fi provisioning information stored in the non-volatile memory (NVM) of the device.
  * ``connection_info``: Includes Wi-Fi connection details.
  * ``scan_info``: Includes the parameters used for the AP scan.

* ``Result``: Carries asynchronous data about the operation status.

  * If the command is ``START_SCAN``, the result message sent to the configurator contains information about the AP.
    Each ``Result`` contains information related to one AP.
  * If the command is ``SET_CONFIG``, when the Wi-Fi status changes (for example, from disconnected to connected), the configurator receives a result message with the new status.
    Meanwhile, the Wi-Fi credentials are stored in the non-volatile memory of the device.

See all definitions in :file:`./common/proto`.

Operations
==========

The message sequence is the same for all operations, with variations depending on the command:

1. The configurator sends an encoded ``Request`` message with a command to the device.
#. The device carries out the command.
#. The device sends a ``Response`` message to the configurator.
#. For some operations, the device also sends a ``Result`` message to the configurator with any additional data generated or reported.

See :ref:`wifi_provisioning_message_types` for more information on the commands and additional parameters.

Configuration management
************************

The configuration management component manages Wi-Fi configurations.
It uses the :ref:`lib_wifi_credentials` library to handle the configurations in flash.
The component has one slot in RAM to save the configurations.

You can save the configuration in flash or RAM during provisioning.
