The BluetoothÂ® Low Energy (LE) GATT Nordic UART Service is a custom service that receives and writes data and serves as a bridge to the UART interface.

The NUS Service is used in the :ref:`peripheral_uart` sample.
It is also included with the Thingy:91 :ref:`connectivity_bridge`, but is disabled by default, and with the :ref:`Matter door lock sample <matter_lock_sample>`, as an optional feature that extends the Bluetooth LE connectivity.
