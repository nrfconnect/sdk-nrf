Scheduler Client

The Scheduler Client model remotely controls the state of a :ref:`bt_mesh_scheduler_srv_readme` model.

Unlike the Scheduler Server model, the Scheduler Client only creates a single model instance in the mesh composition data.
The Scheduler Client can send messages to both the Scheduler Server and the Scheduler Setup Server, as long as it has the right application keys.

Action scheduling example
*************************

This simple example shows how the Scheduler Client can configure the Scheduler Server models managing the light system.
Every year, and every working day throughout the year, the Scheduler Server will turn the light on at 8:00 and turn it off again at 16:00.

Shell commands
**************

The Bluetooth mesh shell subsystem provides a set of commands to interact with the Scheduler Client model instantiated on a device.

To make these commands available, enable the following Kconfig options:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_SHELL`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_SHELL_SCHEDULER_CLI`

mdl_sched instance get-all
	Print all instances of the Scheduler Client model on the device.


mdl_sched instance set <elem_idx>
	Select the Scheduler Client model instantiated on the specified element ID.
	This instance will be used in message sending.
	If no model instance is selected, the first model instance found on the device will be used by default.

	* ``elem_idx`` - Element index where the model instance is found.


mdl_sched get
	Get the current Schedule Register status.


mdl_sched action-get <idx>
	Get the appropriate Scheduler Action status.

	* ``idx`` - Index of the Schedule Register entry to get.


mdl_sched action-ctx-set <year> <month> <day> <hour> <minute> <second> <day_of_week> <action> <transition_time> <scene_number>
	Set the appropriate Scheduler Action.
	Used in combination with ``mdl_sched action-set`` or ``mdl_sched action-set-unack``.

	* ``year`` - Two last digits of the scheduled year for the action, or 0x64 for any year.
	* ``month`` - Scheduled month for the action.
	* ``day`` - Scheduled day of the month for the action.
	* ``hour`` - Scheduled hour for the action.
	* ``minute`` - Scheduled minute for the action.
	* ``second`` - Scheduled second for the action.
	* ``day_of_week`` - Schedule days of the week for the action.
	* ``action`` - Action to be performed at the scheduled time.
	* ``transition_time`` - Transition time for this action in milliseconds.
	* ``scene_number`` - Scene number to be used for some actions.


mdl_sched action-set <idx>
	Send the current Scheduler Action context and wait for a response.

	* ``idx`` - Index of the Schedule Register entry to set.


mdl_sched action-set-unack <idx>
	Send the current Scheduler Action context without requesting a response.

	* ``idx`` - Index of the Schedule Register entry to set.
