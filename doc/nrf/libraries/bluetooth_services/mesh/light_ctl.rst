The Color-Tunable Light (CTL) models allow remote control and configuration of CTLs on a mesh device.

The Light CTL models can represent the lightness states on a linear or preceptually uniform lightness scale.
See :ref:`bt_mesh_lightness_readme` for details.

The Light CTL models also feature their own common types, listed below.
For types common to all models, see :ref:`bt_mesh_models`.
