The Light Lightness models allow remote control and configuration of dimmable lights on a mesh device.

The Light Lightness models can represent light in the following ways:

- *Actual*: Lightness is represented on a perceptually uniform lightness scale.
- *Linear*: Lightness is represented on a linear scale.

The relationship between the *Actual* and the *Linear* representations is the following:

*Light (Linear) = (Light (Actual))*:sup:`2`

Bindings with other states are always made to the *Actual* representation.

The Light Lightness models also feature their own common types, listed below.
For types common to all models, see :ref:`bt_mesh_models`.

The application can select whether to use the Actual or Linear representation.
To do so, use the following options in the API at compile time:

* :option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_LIGHTNESS_ACTUAL` - Used by default.
* :option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_LIGHTNESS_LINEAR`

Internally, the models will always support both representations, so nodes with different representations can be be used interchangeably.
