All models in the BluetoothÂ® Mesh model specification share some common data types, which are collected in a single header file.
These include transitions, common IDs and other types that are rarely actively used.

Each Bluetooth Mesh model can also contain its own common types, listed in the respective documentation pages.

The following section defines types that are common for all models.
