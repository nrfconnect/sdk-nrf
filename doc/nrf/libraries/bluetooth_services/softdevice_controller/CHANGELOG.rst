All the notable changes to this project are documented on this page.

Main branch
***********

Changes
=======

* The controller now returns the error code ``0x12`` if the same subevent index is used multiple times in LE Set Periodic Advertising Subevent Data.
  This conforms to erratas ES23466 and ES23424. (DRGN-20736)

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where the LE Set Periodic Advertising Subevent Data command could fail when providing data at the same time as an ``AUX_SYNC_SUBEVENT_IND`` was sent. (DRGN-20762)

nRF Connect SDK v2.5.0
**********************

All the notable changes included in the |NCS| v2.5.0 release are documented in this section.

Added
=====

* Experimental support for isochronous channels, both Connected Isochronous Streams and Broadcast Isochronous Streams.
  The controller supports an ISO interval equal to the SDU interval, using unframed PDUs.
  The following HCI commands are now supported:

    * Read Connection Accept Timeout
    * Write Connection Accept Timeout
    * LE Read Buffer Size [v2]
    * LE Read ISO TX Sync
    * LE Set CIG Parameters
    * LE Set CIG Parameters Test
    * LE Create CIS
    * LE Remove CIG
    * LE Accept CIS Request
    * LE Reject CIS Request
    * LE Create BIG
    * LE Create BIG Test
    * LE Terminate BIG
    * LE BIG Create Sync
    * LE BIG Terminate Sync
    * LE Setup ISO Data Path
    * LE Remove ISO Data Path
    * LE ISO Transmit Test
    * LE ISO Receive Test
    * LE ISO Read Test Counters
    * LE ISO Test End
    * LE Set Host Feature
    * LE Read ISO Link Quality

* Experimental support for the Quality of Service (QoS) channel survey.
  See the :c:func:`sdc_hci_cmd_vs_qos_channel_survey_enable` function.
* Support for starting the scanner without setting scan parameters.
  Previously the controller would assert (DRGN-17623).
* Vendor-specific HCI command to enable utilization of remote APR on the local TX power when using LE Power Control.
  See :c:func:`sdc_hci_cmd_vs_set_power_control_apr_handling` (DRGN-17355).

Changes
=======

* Host now always receives LE Transmit Power Reporting Events.
  Previously, some events might not be received when remote and local power changes were applied to the same PHY simultaneously. (DRGN-18950)
* :c:func:`sdc_hci_cmd_put` and :c:func:`sdc_hci_cmd_vs_read_supported_vs_commands` functions are removed.
  This change does not affect applications developed in the |NCS| context. (DRGN-19281)
* When creating a connection or periodic advertiser, the controller will now attempt to select the interval so that it causes as few scheduling conflicts with existing periodic activities as possible.
  The selected interval is always in the range ``[interval_min, interval_max]``, where ``interval_min`` and ``interval_max`` are provided by the host.
  Previously, the controller always selected ``interval_max``.
* The ``SDC_CFG_TYPE_EVENT_LENGTH`` configuration is removed.
  An application must use the :c:func:`sdc_hci_cmd_vs_event_length_set` HCI command instead.
* The ChSel bit in a ``CONNECT_IND`` PDU will now match the ChSel bit in the ``ADV_IND`` PDU.
  Previously, this was always set to indicate channel selection algorithm 2. (DRGN-19115)
* The LE Power Control Request feature is now :ref:`supported <nrf:software_maturity>` instead of experimental. (DRGN-17499)
* :c:func:`sdc_soc_flash_write_async` and :c:func:`sdc_soc_flash_page_erase_async` functions are removed.
  This change does not affect applications developed in the |NCS| context. (DRGN-20451)
* When synchronizing to a periodic advertiser, the number of events skipped is restricted so that there are at least three opportunities to receive before timing out.
  Previously, only one opportunity to receive was guaranteed before timing out. (DRGN-20448)

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where the continuous extended scanner would not be able to receive the ``AUX_ADV_IND`` packet if the time between the ``ADV_EXT_IND`` and ``AUX_ADV_IND`` was more than 840 Î¼s (DRGN-19460).
* Fixed an issue where the stack would dereference a NULL pointer when a resolvable :c:enum:`own_address_type` was used in the HCI Le Extended Create Connection V2 command while the resolving list was empty (DRGN-19580).
* Fixed an issue where the HCI Reset command would not clear the channel map set by the host using the HCI Le Set Host Channel Classification command (DRGN-19623).
* Fixed a bug where the ``Peer_Address_Type`` parameter in the ``LE Connection Complete`` event was set to ``2`` or ``3`` in case the connection was established to a device whose address was resolved (DRGN-18411).
  The least significant bit of the ``Peer_Address_Type`` parameter was set correctly.
* Fixed an issue where the stack would assert if trying to set up more advertisers than there are available advertising sets (DRGN-20118).
* Fixed an issue where enabling an extended advertising set would assert in cases where a host-provided address was not needed and no address had been set up for the advertising set (DRGN-20085).
* Fixed an issue where the controller acting as a central would assert when receiving a non-compliant LL_PHY_RSP from a peer device (DRGN-20578).
* Fixed an issue that could occur when the Host Number of Complete Packets command was sent with a connection handle the controller had already raised a disconnect event for.
  The controller would return ``BT_HCI_ERR_INVALID_PARAM`` to the command, which would mean that the host could not return the buffer to the controller (DRGN-20654).

* Receiving a Periodic Advertisement Sync Transfer (PAST) with invalid parameters will now generate the ``LE Periodic Advertising Sync Transfer Received`` event when receiving PAST is enabled (DRGN-18803).
* Periodic advertiser is allocated from the Periodic Advertising with Responses (PAwR) Advertiser sets when :c:enum:`SDC_CFG_TYPE_PERIODIC_ADV_RSP_COUNT` is available.
  Otherwise, it is allocated from the Periodic Advertiser sets if :c:enum:`SDC_CFG_TYPE_PERIODIC_ADV_COUNT` is set (DRGN-18979).
* The controller now returns the error code ``0x0D`` instead of ``0x09`` if it has insufficient resources to handle more connections and the host tries to start a connectable advertiser or the controller receives the commands ``LE Extended Create Connection`` or ``LE Create Connection`` (DRGN-18944).
* Periodic Advertising with Responses (PAwR) Advertiser is supported (DRGN-18497).

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed a rare issue where the controller could assert when starting a connectable advertiser or creating a connection too quickly after disconnection (DRGN-18714).

  This occurred when using MPSL FEM and manually configuring the radio power (DRGN-18971).
* Fixed an issue where the controller cannot synchronize to a periodic advertising train using the Periodic Advertising Sync Transfer procedure if it has previously tried to do it while it was already synchronized to the periodic advertising train (DRGN-19003).
* Fixed an issue where the peripheral would disconnect with DIFFERENT_TRANSACTION_COLLISION when a collision of a connection update and a PHY update occurs even when central asks for no change (DRGN-18840).
* Fixed a rare issue where the controller would assert when multiple instances of the same Bluetooth role were running and one of the instances was being stopped (DRGN-18424).
* Fixed an issue where the SoftDevice Controller would not accept an ``adv_handle`` provided in HCI commands with values above the configured number of advertising sets (DRGN-19058).
* Fixed an issue where the controller could assert while synchronized to a Periodic Advertiser (DRGN-18883).
* Fixed an issue where the controller fails to advertise using extended advertising in the first advertising event after an increase in advertising data payload (DRGN-19197).

nRF Connect SDK v2.1.3
**********************

All the notable changes included in the |NCS| v2.1.3 release are documented in this section.

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue in MPSL where the controller would assert when a Bluetooth role was running (DRGN-17851).

nRF Connect SDK v2.1.2
**********************

All the notable changes included in the |NCS| v2.1.2 release are documented in this section.

Changes
=======

* On nRF53, the fix for Errata 158 is now applied.

nRF Connect SDK v2.1.0
**********************

All the notable changes included in the |NCS| v2.1.0 release are documented in this section.

Added
=====

* Support for changing the radio transmitter's default power level using :c:func:`sdc_default_tx_power_set` (DRGN-15903).
* Support for disabling or enabling peripheral latency using :c:func:`sdc_hci_cmd_vs_peripheral_latency_mode_set` (DRGN-15706).
* Stub version of :c:func:`sdc_hci_get` for getting all types of HCI packets from the Link Layer (DRGN-17060).
* Experimental support for generic coex (DRGN-17128).

Changes
=======

* When the SoftDevice Controller is used with the Front-End Module provided by the :ref:`mpsl`, the transmit power is expressed as the power on the antenna instead of the power of the SoC output.
  This allows dynamic gain control of the Front-End Module if the selected Front-End Module supports it.
  The default transmit power for Bluetooth LE activities does not change, so if the Front-End Module has an exemplary gain of +10 dB, the output power of the SoC will be decreased accordingly.
  To achieve higher output powers on the antenna, the user must call the appropriate API.
  For :c:func:`sdc_hci_cmd_vs_zephyr_write_tx_power` the transmit power is expressed as the maximum power on the antenna.
  The returned transmit power is the power on the antenna that can be achieved on the current SoC and Front-End Module.
  For :c:func:`sdc_hci_cmd_vs_zephyr_read_tx_power` the returned transmit power is the power on the antenna that can be achieved on the current SoC and Front-End Module.
  (KRKNWK-13714)
* Improved channel selection for secondary advertising packets (DRGN-17452).
* The extended advertiser will now always include the SyncInfo in the AUX_ADV_IND if there is a corresponding periodic advertiser, even if the offset cannot be represented (DRGN-16240).
* Split the function :c:func:`sdc_support_dle` into :c:func:`sdc_support_dle_central` and :c:func:`sdc_support_dle_peripheral`.
* Added functions :c:func:`sdc_support_phy_update_central` and :c:func:`sdc_support_phy_update_peripheral`, to enable change of PHY independently of the functions :c:func:`sdc_support_le_coded_phy` and :c:func:`sdc_support_le_2m_phy`
  These changes reduce the code size when using only central or peripheral role. (DRGN-17592)
* Applications may now configure fewer TX/RX buffers than the default.
  Note that this may lead to reduced throughput (DRGN-17651).
* The scanner is now scheduling cooperatively when the sum of scan windows is equal to the scan interval.
  This improves scheduling performance when scanning concurrently on multiple PHYs (DRGN-17754).
* Improved scheduling performance when synchronized to a periodic advertiser sending packets on Coded PHY (DRGN-17754).

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed a HardFault that could occur when receiving legacy PDUs while using the periodic advertising synchronization functionality (DRGN-17656).
* Fixed an issue where the maximum data length capabilities were set to 27 bytes when the configured event length (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_SDC_MAX_CONN_EVENT_LEN_DEFAULT`) was more than 65535 us (DRGN-17454).
* Fixed an issue where using the memory macros in :file:`sdc.h` with fewer TX/RX buffers than the default would report incorrect memory usage (DRGN-17651).
* Fixed an issue where the periodic advertiser sends its AUX_SYNC_IND 40 us later than indicated in the SyncInfo of the AUX_ADV_IND packet (DRGN-17710).
* Fixed an issue where the scanner would attempt to receive the first AUX_SYNC_IND 40 us later than indicated in the SyncInfo of the AUX_ADV_IND packet (DRGN-17710).

* Added radio front-end module (FEM) support, based on the :ref:`mpsl_fem` (nRF52 Series only) (DRGN-11059).
* Added support for the vendor-specific HCI command: Read Supported Vendor Specific Commands (DRGN-13763).
* Added support for the vendor-specific HCI command: Zephyr Read Key Hierarchy Roots (DRGN-13237).
* Added support for nRF5340, which was previously only supported for evaluation purposes (DRGN-8639).

Changes
=======

* Moved permanent limitations from the :ref:`nrf:known_issues` page to :ref:`softdevice_controller_limitations`.
* Increased the maximum supported radio output power on nRF53 Series devices from 0 dBm to 3 dBm.
  If the output power is above 0 dBm, NRF_VREQCTRL->VREGRADIO.VREQH is set (DRGN-15476).
* Reduced ``SDC_DEFAULT_RX_PACKET_COUNT`` from 3 to 2. Now the controller can achieve full throughput with only two RX buffers (DRGN-7696).
* Decoupled the controller from the random number generator (DRGN-12507).
  This functionality must now be provided by the user.
  The user must provide ``rand_prio_low_get()``, ``rand_prio_high_get()`` and ``rand_poll()`` through the newly introduced :c:func:`sdc_rand_source_register()`.
  These functions can be mapped to the Zephyr Entropy APIs:

    * ``rand_prio_low_get()`` <-> ``entropy_get_entropy_isr()`` (``*_isr()`` for nonblocking behavior)
    * ``rand_prio_high_get()`` <-> ``entropy_get_entropy_isr()``
    * ``rand_poll()`` <-> ``entropy_get_entropy()``

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where a slave connection could disconnect prematurely if there were scheduling conflicts with other roles (DRGN-15469).
* Fixed an issue where the channel map provided by the LE Host Set Channel Classification HCI command was not applied on the secondary advertising channels (DRGN-13594).
* The SoftDevice Controller can now be qualified on nRF52832 (DRGN-15382).
* Fixed an issue where setting a legacy advertiser's scan response data using extended advertising HCI commands corrupted the advertising data (DRGN-15465).
* Fixed an issue where, in rare cases, an assert could occur when receiving a packet as a slave.
  This could only occur after performing a data length procedure on Coded PHY (DRGN-15251).
* Fixed an issue where "HCI Read RSSI" would always return a Command Disallowed (0x0C) error code (DRGN-15310).
* Fixed an issue where setting radio output power using the vendor-specific HCI command Zephyr Write TX Power Level returned "Unsupported Feature or Parameter value (0x11)".
  Now the controller will select an output power level that is lower or equal to the one requested.
  The command returns success and the selected power level (DRGN-15369).
* Fixed an issue where an assert could occur when running an extended advertiser with maximum data length and minimum interval on Coded PHY.
  The assert would only occur if there were scheduling conflicts (DRGN-15694).
* Fixed an issue where a connectable or scannable advertiser ends with sending a packet without listening for the CONNECT_IND, AUX_CONNECT_REQ, and SCAN_REQ (DRGN-15484).
* Fixed an issue where an extended advertiser with limited duration may time out after the first primary channel packet in the last advertising event (DRGN-10367).
* Fixed an issue where the coding scheme provided by the LE Set PHY HCI Command was ignored after a remote initiated PHY procedure (DRGN-15531).
* Fixed an issue where the controller may still have pending events after :c:func:`sdc_hci_evt_get()` returns false.
  This would only occur if the host has masked out events (DRGN-15758).
* Fixed an issue where the extended scanner generated reports containing truncated data from a chained advertising PDU (DRGN-13338).

* ``hci_vs_cmd_zephyr_read_supported_commands_return_t`` was converted from a struct to a union.
  The content remains the same.
* The VersNr field in the LL_VERSION_IND packet now contains the value 0x0B to indicate Bluetooth Core Specification v5.2 compliance.
* The previously implemented Vendor Specific HCI command opcodes are now offset with 0x100.
* The previously implemented Vendor Specific HCI event codes are now offset with 0x80.
* When the controller receives an unknown command, it will raise "Command Status event" instead of "Command Complete event".
* When in slave latency, the controller now picks up data from the host for transmission earlier than it used to.
* In the LE Extended Advertising Report, the Direct Address Type values 0x02, 0x03, and 0xFE will only be used when the Scanning Filter Policy is equal to 0x02 or 0x03 and TargetA is a resolvable private address.
  If the address is resolved, then the Direct Address Type will contain the same value as the Own Address Type parameter of the command LE Set Extended Scan Parameters.
  This follows the Bluetooth Core Specification v5.2.
* On nRF53, the fix for Errata 16 is now applied.

nRF Connect SDK v1.2.0
**********************

All the notable changes included in the nRF Connect SDK v1.2.0 release are documented in this section.

Added
=====

* Added :c:func:`ble_controller_support_dle` which makes LE Data Length Extension support configurable.
* Added preliminary support for the S140 variant with the nRF5340 device.
  The Bluetooth LE Controller for nRF5340 supports the same feature set as its nRF52 Series counterpart.
  The following library has been added:

  * :file:`ble_controller/lib/cortex-m33+nodsp/soft-float/libble_controller_s140.a`

Changes
=======

* :c:func:`mpsl_init` is no longer called by :c:func:`ble_controller_init`.
  Application is therefore responsible for calling :c:func:`mpsl_init`, and it must be done before :c:func:`ble_controller_init` is called.
* Clock configuration parameters are now contained in :c:type:`mpsl_clock_lfclk_cfg_t` instead of :c:type:`nrf_lf_clock_cfg_t`, and must be provided to :c:func:`mpsl_init` instead of :c:func:`ble_controller_init`.
* Clock accuracy must now be specified in parts per million (ppm) instead of the previous enum value.
* The IRQ line to pend for low priority signal processing must be provided to :c:func:`mpsl_init` instead of :c:func:`ble_controller_init`.
* The application must call :c:func:`mpsl_low_priority_process` instead of :c:func:`ble_controller_low_prio_tasks_process` to process low priority signals.
* :c:func:`mpsl_uninit` is no longer called by :c:func:`ble_controller_disable`.
  Application must therefore call :c:func:`mpsl_uninit` after :c:func:`ble_controller_disable` to uninitialize MPSL.
* Interrupt handler APIs for the following peripherals are moved to MPSL: RADIO, RTC0, TIMER0, and POWER_CLOCK.
* High-frequency clock API (``ble_controller_hf_clock_...``) is removed.
  Use the corresponding API in MPSL instead.
* Temperature API (:c:func:`ble_controller_temp_get`) is removed.
  Use the corresponding API in MPSL instead.
* Timeslot API is removed.
  Use the corresponding API in MPSL instead.
* Version numbers have been removed from the libraries.

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where the application could not immediately restart a connectable advertiser after a high duty cycle advertiser timed out.
* Fixed an issue where a control packet could be sent twice even after the packet was ACKed.
  This would only occur if the radio was forced off due to an unforeseen condition.
* Fixed an issue in HCI LE Set Extended Scan Enable where ``UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE`` was returned when duplicate filtering was enabled.
* Fixed an issue in HCI LE Set Advertising Parameters where ``UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE`` was returned when ``secondary_max_skip`` was set to a non-zero value.
  This issue occurred when sending a packet on either LE 1M or LE 2M PHY after receiving or transmitting a packet on
  LE Coded PHY.
  If this occurred while performing a Link Layer Control Procedure, the controller could end up retransmitting
  an ACKed packet, resulting in a disconnect.
* Fixed an issue where an assert could occur when receiving a packet with a CRC error after performing a data length procedure on Coded PHY.
* Fixed an issue where an assert occurred when setting a secondary PHY to 0 when using HCI LE Set Extended Advertising Parameters.
  This issue occurred when the advertising type was set to legacy advertising.

********************************************

All the notable changes included in this release are documented in this section.

Added
=====

* Added support for nRF52833.

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where :c:func:`hci_data_get` could return "No data available" when there was data available.
  This issue would only occur when connected to multiple devices at the same time.

nRF Bluetooth LE Controller 0.3.0-2.prealpha
********************************************

All the notable changes included in this release are documented in this section.

Bug fixes

nRF Bluetooth LE Controller 0.3.0-1.prealpha
********************************************

All the notable changes included in this release are documented in this section.

Added
=====

* Increased the number of supported SoC and library combinations.
* Added API for estimating the dynamic memory usage returned by :c:func:`ble_controller_cfg_set`.
* Added a new header :file:`ble_controller_hci_vs.h` that exposes definitions of
  Vendor-Specific HCI commands and events.
* Added support for connection intervals less than the standard minimum of 7.5 ms.
  Note that this is a proprietary feature that is not Bluetooth compliant.
  This proprietary feature is named 'Low Latency Packet Mode (LLPM)'.
* Added support for enabling or disabling connection event length extension.
  When disabled, the maximum connection event length is set by ``ble_controller_cfg_event_length_t::event_length_us``.
  When enabled, the maximum connection event length is determined by the connection interval.
* Added support for generating QoS Connection event reports.
  When enabled, one report is generated with every connection event.
  The report contains information that can be used to change the Bluetooth LE channel map.

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where the "HCI Read Local Supported Commands" command did not indicate support for the "HCI LE Set Privacy Mode" command.
* Fixed an issue where an ASSERT occurred when setting advertising data after HCI Reset without setting advertising parameters.
* Fixed an issue where an ASSERT occurred when writing to flash.
* Fixed an issue where a directed advertiser could time out without sending a packet on air.

Changes
=======
