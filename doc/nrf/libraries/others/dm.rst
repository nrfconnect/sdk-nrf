The Distance Measurement module provides an integration of :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_dm` into |NCS|.

Overview
********

The Distance Measurement module is independent of the communication protocol used.
The :ref:`nrfxlib:mpsl` library is used to access the radio module.
The distance is measured during the allocated timeslot.

Ranging
*******

When a new ranging request arrives, the module checks if a timeslot for the ranging can be scheduled.
It also checks if the request fits in the schedule of rangings.
Rangings are not executed immediately but are scheduled for future execution.
This gives additional flexibility.
New ranging requests may arrive at any point in time.

If the request can be scheduled, the module performs the ranging after the time set in the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DM_RANGING_OFFSET_US` option has passed.
The ranging is executed within a timeslot.
After ranging, a callback is called to store or process the measurement data.

Using Distance Measurement
**************************

To use the Distance Measurement module, enable it using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_DM` Kconfig option and initialize it in your application.
After synchronizing, the nodes that should perform the measurement with each other issue the measurement request.
The callback function :c:func:`data_ready` is called when the measurement data is available.

Complete the following steps:

1. Enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_DM` Kconfig option.
#. Include :file:`dm.h` in your :file:`main.c` file.
#. Call :c:func:`dm_init()` to initialize the module.
#. Call :c:func:`dm_request_add()` to perform the measurement.

Configuration
*************

To use the Distance Measurement module, enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_DM` Kconfig option.

Synchronization
---------------

To adjust the synchronization of the nodes, change the values of the following options:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DM_INITIATOR_DELAY_US` - Extra delay of start of initiator role in distance measurement. Reducing this decreases power consumption but leads to less successful rangings.
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DM_REFLECTOR_DELAY_US` - Extra delay of start of reflector role in distance measurement.
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DM_MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_TIMESLOTS_US` - Minimum time between two timeslots. This should account for processing of the ranging data after the timeslot.

It is possible to enable an output pin state change when an event related to this module occurs.
You can use this functionality to determine the synchronization accuracy.
A logic analyzer or oscilloscope will be helpful for this purpose.

Enabling the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DM_GPIO_DEBUG` option changes the state of the pins when a new measurement request is added and the timeslot is assigned.
To assign the pin numbers, use the options :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DM_RANGING_PIN` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DM_ADD_REQUEST_PIN`.

Use the following options to configure the timeslot queue:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DM_TIMESLOT_QUEUE_LENGTH` - Maximum number of scheduled timeslots.
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DM_TIMESLOT_QUEUE_COUNT_SAME_PEER` - Maximum number of timeslots with rangings to the same peer.

For optimal performance and scalability, both peers should come to the same decision to range each other.
Otherwise, one of the peers tries to range the other peer that is not listening and therefore wastes power and time during this operation.

The option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DM_RANGING_OFFSET_US` defines the time between the synchronization (adding a request) and ranging.
Increasing this allows for more rangings to different nodes but also increases latency.

If you enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DM_TIMESLOT_RESCHEDULE` option, the device will try to range the same peer again if the previous ranging was successful.
