Libraries for Zigbee
####################

|zigbee_description|
See the :ref:`ug_zigbee` user guide for an overview of the technology.

Zigbee libraries are a set of components that can be directly reused in Zigbee applications.
They implement the default behavior of a Zigbee device and are used in :ref:`zigbee_samples` in this SDK.

The following table lists libraries enabled by default for each available Zigbee sample (✔) or available through a configuration file (``**``):

Read the table symbols in the following manner:

* ``✔`` - The library is enabled by default for the given Zigbee sample.
* ``**`` - The library support is available through the :file:`prj_fota.conf` for the given Zigbee sample.
* No symbol - The library is not enabled for the given sample, but you can enable support by following the instructions on the :ref:`ug_zigbee_configuring_libraries`.
