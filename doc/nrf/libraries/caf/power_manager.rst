CAF: Power manager module
#########################

   :depth: 2

The |power_manager| of the :ref:`lib_caf` (CAF) is responsible for reducing the energy consumption of battery-powered devices.
The module achieves this reduction by switching to low power modes when the device is not used for a longer period of time.

Configuration
*************

To enable the |power_manager|, set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_POWER_MANAGER` Kconfig option in the configuration.

Implied features
================

The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_POWER_MANAGER` option implies the following features that can be used to reduce power consumption:

* System power off support (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_POWEROFF`).
  The option is not implied for an nRF54H Series SoC (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_SERIES_NRF54HX`), because the :c:func:`sys_poweroff` API is not yet fully supported on the nRF54H Series SoC.
* Device Power Management (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_DEVICE`).
  The option allows to reduce the power consumption of device drivers while they are inactive.
  It is recommended to disable the feature if your application does not use device drivers that integrate device power management.
  Disabling the feature reduces the memory footprint.

nRF54H Series SoC
-----------------

For the nRF54H Series SoC (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_SERIES_NRF54HX`), the module also implies the following features:

* Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:pm-system` (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM`).
  The nRF54H Series SoC (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_SERIES_NRF54HX`) integrates the system power management to reduce power consumption when inactive.
* Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:pm-device-runtime` (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME`).
  The option extends device power management and depends on the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_DEVICE` Kconfig option.
  Enabling the device runtime power management also prevents using system-managed device power management (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_SYSTEM_MANAGED`) by default.
  The system-managed device power management does not work properly with some drivers (for example, nrfx UARTE) and should be avoided.

Timeout configuration options
=============================

With the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_POWER_MANAGER_TIMEOUT` Kconfig option, you can set the period of time after which the application enters the low power mode.
By default, the timeout is set to 120 seconds.

The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_POWER_MANAGER_ERROR_TIMEOUT` option sets the period of time after which the device is turned off upon an internal error.

Blocking system off
===================

The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_POWER_MANAGER_STAY_ON` Kconfig option prevents system off (:c:func:`sys_poweroff`) even if there are no active :ref:`power state restrictions <caf_power_manager_power_state_restrictions>`.
If you enable the option, the device stays in a suspended state, but will not enter the system off state.
If you disable the power off functionality (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_POWEROFF`), the module never enters the system off state (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_POWER_MANAGER_STAY_ON` is enabled and has no prompt, and you cannot change the Kconfig option).

Forcing power down
==================

If :c:struct:`force_power_down_event` is enabled in the configuration (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_FORCE_POWER_DOWN_EVENTS`), any application module can submit the event to force a quick power down without waiting.
The event triggers instantly suspending the application.

Clearing reset reason
=====================

The module by default clears the reset reason register (``RESETREAS``) right before entering the system off state (right before calling :c:func:`sys_poweroff`).
This is done to avoid starting MCUboot serial recovery if nobody has cleared it already.
Disable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_POWER_MANAGER_CLEAR_RESET_REASON` Kconfig option to prevent this behavior.
Clearing reset reason functionality is not used for the nRF54H Series SoC (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_SERIES_NRF54HX`) as it uses SUIT DFU.

.. note::
  The reset reason register is not cleared in case system is turned off after a fatal error.

Implementation details
**********************

The |power_manager| is started when the "main" is ready (which is reported using :c:struct:`module_state_event`).
The module is responsible for controlling the application power state:

* If the device is in use, the |power_manager| keeps everything active and temporarily allows for bigger power consumption to ensure high responsiveness.
* When the device is not used for a longer period of time, the |power_manager| suspends the application to reduce the power consumption.
  In case of user action while in a suspended state, the |power_manager| switches the application back to the active state.
* In case of an error, the |power_manager| reports the error to the user and then turns off the application.

A dedicated set of application events can be used to communicate with the |power_manager|.
The predefined set of events is used while suspending or waking up the application.
Another events can be used to affect policy used by the |power_manager|.

See the following sections for detailed information about the used application power states, transitions between them and interactions of the |power_manager| with other application modules.

Application power state
=======================

The application can be in the following power states:

* `Idle`_
* `Suspended`_
* `Off`_
* `Error`_
* `Error Off`_

   Power manager state handling in CAF

See the following sections for more details on every application power state.

Idle
----

In this state, the |power_manager| does not perform any actions to limit power consumption of the application modules.
The application modules can remain active and keep the controlled peripherals turned on, including LEDs.

If no application module applies :ref:`caf_power_manager_power_state_restrictions`, the power-down counter is active.
On timeout, the |power_manager| enters the suspended state.

There are some events that reset the power-down counter:

* :c:struct:`keep_alive_event`
* The moment when the last module stops restricting :c:enum:`POWER_MANAGER_LEVEL_ALIVE` - that is, at the moment when any power-down state is allowed, the counter is cleared too.

Suspended
---------

Upon the power-down timeout, the |power_manager| switches the application to the suspended state.
The |power_manager| suspends application modules to reduce power consumption.
After suspending the application modules, the |power_manager| might call :c:func:`sys_poweroff`, so that system enters the off state to reduce the power consumption further.

.. _caf_power_manager_suspending_application_modules:

Suspending application modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |power_manager| submits :c:struct:`power_down_event`.
While handling the event, application modules turn off the used peripherals or switch them to standby to conserve power.
Only after all application modules confirm that they have entered the low power state (by not consuming the :c:struct:`power_down_event`), the |power_manager| sets the required application power state.
The |power_manager| registers itself as the final subscriber of :c:struct:`power_down_event`.
Reception of :c:struct:`power_down_event` indicates that the |power_manager| can continue power down sequence.
See the :c:struct:`power_down_event` documentation for details regarding handling the event in application modules.

Suspending application modules is done to reduce CPU workload and suspend the peripherals.
It is assumed that the operating system will conserve power by setting the CPU state to idle whenever possible.
If the system power management (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM`) is enabled, reducing CPU workload also allows the system power management to enter deeper CPU sleep states.

Wake-up scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any module can trigger the application to switch from the suspended state back to the idle state by submitting :c:struct:`wake_up_event`.
This is normally done on some external event, for example, your interaction on the device.
The |power_manager| sets the application to the idle state.
Then application modules receive :c:struct:`wake_up_event`, which switches them back to the normal operation.

Off
---

After suspending the application modules, the |power_manager| can trigger entering the system off state (:c:func:`sys_poweroff`) to reduce the power consumption further.
The |power_manager| switches the application to the deep sleep (system off) mode if no module :ref:`restricts the system off state <caf_power_manager_power_state_restrictions>` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_POWER_MANAGER_STAY_ON` Kconfig option is disabled.

Switching the application to the system off state is performed by submitting :c:struct:`power_off_event`.
The |power_manager| registers itself as the final subscriber of :c:struct:`power_off_event`.
Reception of :c:struct:`power_off_event` indicates that the |power_manager| can safely call the :c:func:`sys_poweroff` API to enter the system off state.
See the :c:struct:`power_off_event` documentation for details regarding handling the event in application modules.

Eventually all of the application modules are suspended, and the CPU is switched to the deep sleep (off) mode.
In the system off state, the CPU is not running.

Wake-up scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before the application enters the off state, an application module must configure the peripheral under its control, so that it issues a hardware-related event capable of rebooting the CPU (that is, capable of leaving the CPU off mode) when you interact on the device.
After the reboot, the application reinitializes itself.

Error
-----

When any application module switches to the error state (that is, broadcasts :c:enumerator:`MODULE_STATE_ERROR` through :c:struct:`module_state_event`), the |power_manager| puts the application into the error state.
The application modules are :ref:`suspended <caf_power_manager_suspending_application_modules>` using :c:struct:`power_down_event` with :c:member:`power_down_event.error` set to ``true``.
The error field indicates that some of the application modules can stay active to report the error condition to the user (for example, :ref:`caf_leds` can keep working in the error state to display information about the error).

Then, after the period of time defined by the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_POWER_MANAGER_ERROR_TIMEOUT` Kconfig option, the |power_manager| suspends the remaining application modules using :c:struct:`power_down_event` with :c:member:`power_down_event.error` set to ``false``.

.. note::
   In the error state, |power_manager| prevents waking up application by consuming the submitted :c:struct:`wake_up_event`.

Error Off
---------

In the error state, after suspending all of the application modules, the |power_manager| unconditionally triggers entering the system error off state using :c:struct:`power_off_event` with :c:member:`power_off_event.error` set to ``true``.
If entering the system off after the error, the :ref:`power state restrictions <caf_power_manager_power_state_restrictions>` and value of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_POWER_MANAGER_STAY_ON` Kconfig option are ignored.

.. _caf_power_manager_power_state_restrictions:

Power state restrictions
========================

Any application module can restrict the power state allowed by the usage of :c:struct:`power_manager_restrict_event`.
It provides the module ID and the deepest allowed power state.
The |power_manager| uses flags to track restrictions imposed by an application module.
This means that you can repeatedly send the :c:struct:`power_manager_restrict_event` to update restrictions applied by a given application module.
