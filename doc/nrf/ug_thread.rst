Thread is a low-power mesh networking technology, designed specifically for home automation applications.
It is an IPv6-based standard that uses 6LoWPAN technology over the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol.
You can connect a Thread mesh network to the Internet with a Thread Border Router.

The |NCS| provides support for developing Thread applications based on the OpenThread stack.
The OpenThread stack is integrated into Zephyr.
