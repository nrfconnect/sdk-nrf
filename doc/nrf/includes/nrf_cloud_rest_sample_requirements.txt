.. requirement_keysign_start

This sample uses the `nRF Cloud REST API`_, which requires that your device has a valid signing key installed and registered with `nRF Cloud`_.

.. requirement_keysign_moreinfo_start

(See `nRF Cloud REST API`_ and `Securely generating credentials on the nRF9160`_ for more details on this requirement).

Modem version v1.3.x or later is also required.

* Your device may ship with modem firmware older than v1.3.x, so verify that you have the latest installed.
* For instructions on updating your device's modem firmware, see the following documents:

  * :ref:`Updating modem firmware on nRF9160 DK <nrf9160_gs_updating_fw_modem>`
  * :ref:`Updating modem firmware on Thingy:91 <programming_thingy>`

.. requirement_cert_provision_start

To obtain and register a valid signing key, you can do one of the following:

* Provision your device on nRF Cloud using Just-In-Time Provisioning (JITP) (detailed below).
* Provision your device on nRF Cloud with preconnect provisioning (detailed in `nRF Cloud Provisioning`_).
* Install or generate a private key on your device and register its public key with nRF Cloud (detailed in `Securely generating credentials on the nRF9160`_).

To provision your device on nRF Cloud using JITP, complete the following steps:

1. :ref:`Ensure valid nRF Cloud credentials are installed <nrf9160_ug_updating_cloud_certificate>`.
   nRF9160 DK and Thingy:91 have credentials pre-installed, but some may be shipped with RSA256 credentials; JWT signing requires ES256 credentials.
   These devices need new credentials to be installed before they can perform REST requests.

#. Install a sample or application that supports JITP.
   You can use the :ref:`Asset Tracker V2 <asset_tracker_v2>` application for this purpose.

#. Allow your device to connect to nRF Cloud and add it to the nRF Cloud portal.
   When successfully provisioned, the device appears in the devices list of the nRF Cloud portal.

#. Once your device is provisioned, you may reinstall this sample and the provisioning persists.
