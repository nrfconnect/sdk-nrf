.. note::
   Programming the nRF54H20 SoC can sometimes fail due to conflicts in the resource configuration.
   This can happen if, for example, an application programmed to the nRF54H20 SoC configured the UICRs for one or more cores in a way that is incompatible with the configuration required by the application you are trying to program on the SoC.

   To fix this error and erase the UICR for the application core, run the following command::

      nrfutil device recover --core Application

   You can then run ``west flash`` to program your application.
   For more information on the command, run::

      nrfutil device recover --help

If your sample also uses the radio core, you must also erase the UICRs for the radio core.
To erase the UICR for the radio core, run the following command::

      nrfutil device recover --core Network
