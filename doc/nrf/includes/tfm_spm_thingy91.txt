The sample is configured to compile and run as a non-secure application.
Therefore, it automatically includes an additional secure firmware component that prepares the required peripherals and secure services to be available for the application.

For nRF9160 DK, when the sample is built using the ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns`` build target, it automatically includes :ref:`Trusted Firmware-M <ug_tfm>`.
You can also configure it to use the :ref:`secure_partition_manager` instead of Trusted Firmware-M.

For Thingy:91, when the sample is built using the ``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` build target, it automatically includes the :ref:`secure_partition_manager`.
You can also configure it to use :ref:`TF-M <ug_tfm>` instead of Secure Partition Manager.
