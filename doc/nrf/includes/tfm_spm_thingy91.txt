The sample is configured to compile and run as a non-secure application.
Therefore, it automatically includes an additional secure firmware component, that prepares the required peripherals and secure services to be available for the application.

When built for the ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns`` build target, the sample automatically includes :ref:`Trusted Firmware-M <ug_tfm>`.
You can also configure it to use the :ref:`secure_partition_manager` instead of Trusted Firmware-M.

When built for the ``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` build target, the sample automatically includes the :ref:`secure_partition_manager`.
You can also configure it to use :ref:`TF-M <ug_tfm>` instead of Secure Partition Manager.
