The sample uses a :file:`prj.conf` configuration file located in the sample root directory for the default configuration.
It also provides additional files for different custom configurations.
When you build the sample, you can select one of these configurations using the :makevar:`FILE_SUFFIX` variable.

See :ref:`app_build_file_suffixes` and :ref:`cmake_options` for more information.
