In the Matter over Wi-Fi variant of this sample, the :ref:`portion of the application code related to the nRF70 Series Wi-Fi firmware <ug_nrf70_developing_fw_patch_ext_flash>` is stored in the external memory.
When you program the sample onto your development kit, the build process automatically includes the Wi-Fi firmware patch and programs it into the external memory.

By default, using the ``west flash`` command erases the entire external flash memory before writing the new Wi-Fi firmware patch.
This full-chip erase ensures that the patch is written to a clean memory area, but it can significantly increase programming time - sometimes taking several minutes, especially if the external flash is large.

To optimize the programming process and reduce the time required, you can instruct ``west flash`` to erase only the specific memory ranges that will be overwritten by the Wi-Fi firmware patch.
This is done by adding the ``--ext-erase-mode=ranges`` argument to the command.
With this option, only the necessary sections of external memory are erased, making the programming process faster.

For example, to program the sample and minimize the erase time, use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   west flash --ext-erase-mode=ranges

You can also observe a longer programming process when using the :guilabel:`Erase and Flash to Board` option in the |nRFVSC|.
To speed up this process, you can use the :guilabel:`Flash` button instead of :guilabel:`Erase and Flash to Board` in the `Actions View`_.

To disable storing the Wi-Fi firmware patch in the external memory, complete the following steps:

1. Remove the Wi-Fi firmware patch partition from the partition list.
#. Set the :kconfig:option:`SB_CONFIG_WIFI_PATCHES_EXT_FLASH_STORE` Kconfig option to ``n``.
#. Set the :kconfig:option:`SB_CONFIG_DFU_MULTI_IMAGE_PACKAGE_WIFI_FW_PATCH` Kconfig option to ``n``.
#. Set the :kconfig:option:`SB_CONFIG_MCUBOOT_UPDATEABLE_IMAGES` Kconfig option to ``2``.
