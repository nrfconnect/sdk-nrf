This application can be found under |application path| in the |NCS| folder structure.

For more security, it is recommended to use the ``*/ns`` :ref:`variant <app_boards_names>` of the board target (see the Requirements section above.)
When built for this variant, the sample is configured to compile and run as a non-secure application using :ref:`security by separation <ug_tfm_security_by_separation>`.
Therefore, it automatically includes :ref:`Trusted Firmware-M <ug_tfm>` that prepares the required peripherals and secure services to be available for the application.

To build the application, follow the instructions in :ref:`building` for your preferred building environment.
See also :ref:`programming` for programming steps and :ref:`testing` for general information about testing and debugging in the |NCS|.
