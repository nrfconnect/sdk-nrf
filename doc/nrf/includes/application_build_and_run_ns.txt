This application can be found under |application path| in the |NCS| folder structure.

When built as a firmware image for a board target with the ``*/ns`` :ref:`variant <app_boards_names>`, the application has :term:`Cortex-M Security Extensions (CMSE)` enabled and separates the firmware between the :term:`Non-Secure Processing Environment (NSPE)` and the :term:`Secure Processing Environment (SPE)`.
Because of this, it automatically includes the :ref:`Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) <ug_tfm>`.
To read more about CMSE, see :ref:`app_boards_spe_nspe`.

To build the application with |VSC|, follow the steps listed on the `How to build an application`_ page in the |nRFVSC| documentation.
See :ref:`building` for other building scenarios, :ref:`programming` for programming steps, and :ref:`testing` for general information about testing and debugging in the |NCS|.
