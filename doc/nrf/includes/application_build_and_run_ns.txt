This application can be found under |application path| in the |NCS| folder structure.

You can build this application as firmware image for a board target with the ``*/ns`` :ref:`variant <app_boards_names>` (see the Requirements section above).
In such cases, the sample has Cortex-M Security Extensions (CMSE) enabled and separates the firmware between Non-Secure Processing Environment (NSPE) and Secure Processing Environment (SPE).
Because of this, it automatically includes the :ref:`Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) <ug_tfm>`.
To read more about CMSE, see :ref:`app_boards_spe_nspe`.

To build the application, follow the instructions in :ref:`building` for your preferred building environment.
See also :ref:`programming` for programming steps and :ref:`testing` for general information about testing and debugging in the |NCS|.
