1. Generate the SUIT envelope by building your application with the FOTA support over Bluetooth Low Energy.
   You can find the generated :file:`root.suit` envelope in the :file:`<build_dir>/DFU` directory.
   Alternatively, you can use the generated :file:`dfu_suit.zip` package in the :file:`<build_dir>/zephyr` directory.
#. Download the :file:`root.suit` envelope or the :file:`dfu_suit.zip` package to your mobile device running the DFU mobile app.

   .. note::
      `nRF Connect for Desktop`_ does not currently support the FOTA process.

#. Use the `nRF Connect Device Manager`_ mobile app to update your device with the new firmware.

   a. Ensure that you can access the :file:`root.suit` envelope or the :file:`dfu_suit.zip` package from your phone or tablet.
   #. In the mobile app, scan and select the device to update.
   #. Switch to the :guilabel:`Image` tab.
   #. In the **Firmware Upgrade** section, tap the :guilabel:`SELECT FILE` button and select the :file:`root.suit` envelope or the :file:`dfu_suit.zip` package.
   #. Tap the :guilabel:`START` button.
   #. Wait for the DFU to finish and then verify that the application works properly.
