This sample can be found under |sample path| in the |NCS| folder structure.

The sample is built as a non-secure firmware image for the nrf9160dk_nrf9160ns build target.
Because of this, it automatically includes the :ref:`secure_partition_manager`.
You can also configure it to use :ref:`TF-M <ug_tfm>` instead of SPM.

See :ref:`gs_programming` for information about how to build and program the application.
