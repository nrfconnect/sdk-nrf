The sample provides predefined :ref:`zephyr:snippets` for typical use cases, and to activate sample extensions.
You can find the snippets in the :file:`snippets` directory of the sample.

Specify the corresponding snippet names in the :makevar:`SNIPPET` option when building with CMake, or as a ``-S`` argument when using west.
