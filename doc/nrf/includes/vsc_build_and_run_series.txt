   .. group-tab:: nRF Connect for VS Code

      You need to set up a build configuration before you program a device in the |nRFVSC|.

      Complete the following steps:

      1. Connect the development kit to your PC using a USB cable.
      #. Power on the development kit.
      #. |exceptions_step|
      #. Open the nRF Connect extension in |VSC| by clicking its icon in the :guilabel:`Activity Bar`.
      #. In the extension's :guilabel:`Actions View`, click on :guilabel:`Flash`.

      For instructions about programming with the |nRFVSC|, see `How to flash an application`_.

      If you want to program with custom options or scripts, read about `Binding custom tasks to actions`_ in the extension documentation.

      For information about how to flash and erase in the |nRFVSC|, read about the `Application-specific flash options`_.

   .. group-tab:: Command line

      Complete the following steps:

      1. Connect the development kit to your PC using a USB cable.
      #. Power on the development kit.
      #. |exceptions_step|
      #. Program the application to the kit using the following command:

         .. code-block:: console

            west flash --erase

         This command erases the full flash memory before programming, which is the recommended approach.
         If the application depends on other flash memory areas (for example, if it uses the :ref:`zephyr:settings_api` partition where bonding information is stored), erasing the full kit before programming ensures that these areas are updated with the new content.
         You can also :ref:`program without erasing <programming_params_no_erase>`.

         The ``west flash`` command automatically resets the kit and starts the application.

      For more information on programming using the command line, see :ref:`Flashing <zephyr:west-flashing>` in the Zephyr documentation.
