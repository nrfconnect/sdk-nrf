   .. group-tab:: nRF Connect for VS Code

      Before you program a device in |nRFVSC|, you need to set up a build configuration, which is part of :ref:`building`.

      Complete the following steps to program the application:

      1. Connect the development kit to your PC using a USB cable.
      #. Power on the development kit.
      #. |exceptions_step|
      #. Open the nRF Connect extension in |VSC| by clicking its icon in the :guilabel:`Activity Bar`.
      #. In the extension's `Actions View`_, click on :guilabel:`Flash`.
         If you have more than one device connected, select the device to program.

         You can select several devices of the same type to program them with the same build configuration.

         If the build system considers the build incomplete, using this action also triggers a rebuild before flashing.

      For instructions about programming with |nRFVSC|, see `How to flash an application`_.

      If you want to program with custom options or scripts, read about `Binding custom tasks to actions`_ in the extension documentation.

      For information about how to flash and erase in |nRFVSC|, read about the `Application-specific flash options`_.

   .. group-tab:: Command line

      Complete the following steps to program the application:

      1. Connect the development kit to your PC using a USB cable.
      #. Power on the development kit.
      #. |exceptions_step|
      #. |open_terminal_window_with_environment|
      #. Program the application to the kit using the following command:

         .. code-block:: console

            west flash --erase

         This command erases the full flash memory before programming, which is the recommended approach.
         If the application depends on other flash memory areas (for example, if it uses the :ref:`zephyr:settings_api` partition where bonding information is stored), erasing the full kit before programming ensures that these areas are updated with the new content.
         You can also :ref:`program without erasing <programming_params_no_erase>`.

      The ``west flash`` command automatically resets the kit and starts the application.

      For more information on programming using the command line, see :ref:`Flashing <zephyr:west-flashing>` in the Zephyr documentation.
