Prepare the development kit for testing
=======================================

Complete the following steps to prepare your development kit for testing:

1. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal_ANSI|
#. If the device was not erased during the programming, press and hold the |First Button| until the factory reset takes place.
#. Commission the device to the Matter network.
   The `Commissioning the device`_ guide walks you through the adding a device to the Matter network processes.

   At the end of this procedure, |First LED| of the Matter device programmed with the sample starts flashing in the Short Flash Off state.
   This indicates that the device is fully provisioned, but does not yet have full IPv6 network connectivity.
