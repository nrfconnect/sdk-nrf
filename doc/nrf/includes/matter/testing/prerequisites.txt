Testing prerequisites
=====================

See the |matter_type| prerequisites that apply to the entire `Testing steps`_ section:

* Use the CHIP Tool controller.
* Replace the *<node_id>*  with a value you selected when `Commissioning the device`_  (for example, ``1``).
* By default, the |endpoint_name| is located at |endpoint_id| endpoint.
  All CHIP Tool commands will use this value.
* Buttons and LED names differ depending on the DKs.
  See the `Buttons and LEDs map`_ to learn which LEDs and Buttons to use while testing the |matter_type|.
