Remote testing in a network
===========================

By default, the Matter accessory device has no IPv6 network configured.
You must pair it with the Matter controller over |Bluetoothsc| LE to get the configuration from the controller to use the device within a Thread or |WiFi| network.
The controller must get the `Onboarding information`_ from the Matter accessory device and provision the device into the network.
For details, see the `Commissioning the device`_ section.

Remote control allows you to control the |matter_name| device from an IPv6 network.

`Commissioning the device`_ allows you to set up a testing environment and remotely control the |matter_type| over a Matter-enabled Thread or Wi-Fi network.

Commissioning the device
========================

To commission the device, see the instructions on the :ref:`ug_matter_gs_testing` page and complete the steps for the Matter over Thread or Matter over Wi-Fi development environment and the Matter controller you want to use.
After choosing the environment configuration, the guide walks you through the following steps:

* Configure the Thread Border Router (only for Matter over Thread communication).
* Build and install the Matter controller.
* Commission the device.
* Send Matter commands that cover scenarios described in the `Testing`_ section.

If you are new to Matter, the recommended approach is to use the :ref:`CHIP Tool for Linux or macOS <ug_matter_configuring_controller>`.
