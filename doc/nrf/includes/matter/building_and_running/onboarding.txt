Onboarding information
----------------------

When you start the commissioning procedure, the controller must get the onboarding information from the Matter accessory device.
The onboarding information representation depends on your commissioner setup.

For this |matter_type|, you can use one of the following :ref:`onboarding information formats <ug_matter_network_topologies_commissioning_onboarding_formats>` to provide the commissioner with the data payload that includes the device discriminator and the setup PIN code:

  .. list-table:: |matter_name| |matter_type| onboarding information
     :header-rows: 1

     * - QR Code
       - QR Code Payload
       - Manual pairing code
     * - Scan the following QR code with the app for your ecosystem:

         |matter_qr_code_image|

       - |matter_qr_code_payload|
       - |matter_pairing_code|

When the factory data support is enabled, the onboarding information will be stored in the build directory in the following files:

   * The :file:`factory_data.png` file includes the generated QR code.
   * The :file:`factory_data.txt` file includes the QR code payload and the manual pairing code.
