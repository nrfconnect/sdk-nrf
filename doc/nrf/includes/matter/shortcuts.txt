.. |matter_dfu| replace:: To upgrade the device firmware, complete the steps listed for the selected method in the :doc:`matter:nrfconnect_examples_software_update` tutorial in the Matter documentation.
.. |matter_ble_advertising_auto| replace:: Before starting the commissioning procedure, make sure that the device is discoverable over Bluetooth LE.
                                           The device becomes discoverable automatically upon the device startup, but only for a predefined period of time (one hour by default).
                                           If the Bluetooth LE advertising times out, enable it again.

.. |matter_ble_advertising_manual| replace:: Before starting the commissioning procedure, you need to enable the Bluetooth LE advertising on your device to make it discoverable.
                                             To do it, press the |First Button|.
                                             The device becomes discoverable automatically upon the device startup, but only for a predefined period of time (one hour by default).
                                             If the Bluetooth LE advertising times out, enable it again.

.. |matter_factory_reset| replace:: To restore the device settings and state to its factory set press the |First Button| for six seconds to initiate the factory reset of the device.
.. |sample_not_in_ecosystem| replace:: The |matter_type| sample, in its default configuration, is not recognized or supported by any major Matter ecosystem.
                                       This is because it does not use a standard Matter device type that ecosystem controllers expect or can interact with.
                                       To make your implementation compatible with a specific ecosystem, you must add an endpoint and assign a device type that is officially supported by that ecosystem.
                                       For detailed instructions on how to add supported clusters and device types, refer to the :ref:`ug_matter_gs_adding_cluster` user guide.
