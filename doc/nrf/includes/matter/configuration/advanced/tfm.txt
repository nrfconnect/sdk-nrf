Support for Trusted Firmware-M
------------------------------

.. toggle::

    The |matter_type| supports using :ref:`Trusted Firmware-M <ug_tfm>` on the |matter_dks_tfm|.
    The memory map of the |matter_type| has been aligned to meet the :ref:`ug_tfm_partition_alignment_requirements`.

    To build the |matter_type| with Trusted Firmware-M support, add the ``ns`` suffix to the |matter_dks_tfm|.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: console

        west build -p -b nrf54l15dk/nrf54l15/cpuapp/ns
