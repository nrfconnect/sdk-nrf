.. note::
   `Matter`_ over Wi-Fi for the nRF5340 SoC is currently in the deprecated mode, and it is not recommended to use it for new Matter designs.
   While critical bug fixes and security updates will be provided as necessary, it will not receive any enhancements or new features, and it will be removed from the :ref:`matter_samples` in the future.
   It is recommended to use the nRF54LM20A SoC in combination with the nRF7002 Expansion Board II shield, which provides a significantly greater amount of available non-volatile memory for Matter over Wi-Fi applications.
