This device works as a Matter accessory device, meaning it can be paired and controlled remotely over a Matter network built on top of a low-power 802.15.4 Thread network as a :ref:`Full Thread Device <thread_ot_device_types>`.

You can use this |matter_type| as a reference for creating your own application.
See the :ref:`ug_matter_creating_accessory` page for an overview of the process you need to follow.
