Device firmware update
----------------------

.. toggle::

    The |matter_type| supports device firmware upgrade (DFU) over-the-air (OTA) using one of the following protocols:

    * Matter OTA update protocol.
      Querying and downloading a new firmware image is done using the Matter operational network.
    * Simple Management Protocol (SMP) over Bluetooth LE.
      The DFU is done using either a smartphone application or a PC command-line tool.
      This protocol is not part of the Matter specification.

    In both cases, the MCUboot secure bootloader is used to apply the new firmware image.

    Matter OTA update protocol is enabled by default.
    To configure the |matter_type| to support the DFU over both Matter and SMP, use the ``-DCONFIG_CHIP_DFU_OVER_BT_SMP=y`` build flag.
