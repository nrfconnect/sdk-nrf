SSED device type
----------------

.. toggle::

    The SSED device type was created for the |matter_name| devices to optimize the power usage of the device and communication pattern with the parent.

    A Thread Synchronized Sleepy End Device (SSED) is synchronized with its parent router and uses the radio only at scheduled intervals, by using the :ref:`thread_ug_supported_features_csl` feature introduced as one of the `Thread 1.2 Base Features`_.
    During those intervals, the device waits for the router to send it any data related to the desired device activity.
    The SSED requires sending packets occasionally to keep in sync with the router.
    However, unlike a regular SED, an SSED does not actively communicate with the router by polling and enters the idle mode between the scheduled activity periods.
    If there is no application-related traffic for an extended period of time, the SSED sends a data poll request packet to synchronize with the parent.
    Compared to a standard SED, the SSED features can further reduce energy consumption of the device and generate less data traffic.
