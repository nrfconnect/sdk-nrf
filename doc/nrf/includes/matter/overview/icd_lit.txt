ICD LIT device type
-------------------

.. toggle::

    The device works as a Matter Intermittently Connected Device (ICD) with a :ref:`Long Idle Time (LIT) <ug_matter_device_low_power_icd_sit_lit>`.
    The device starts operation in the Short Idle Time (SIT) mode and remains in it until it is commissioned to the Matter fabric and registers the first ICD client.
    It then switches the operation mode to LIT to reduce the power consumption.

    In the LIT mode, the device is less responsive than in the SIT mode.
    However, you can request the device to become responsive, for example, to change its configuration.
    Press the |Third Button| to use the User Active Mode Trigger (UAT) feature.

    See the `User interface`_ section for information on how to switch the operation modes.
