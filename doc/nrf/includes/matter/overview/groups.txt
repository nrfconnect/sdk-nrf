Group communication
-------------------

.. toggle::

   Group communication (groupcast or multicast) refers to messages and commands sent to the address of a group that includes multiple devices with the same Groups cluster.
   The cluster manages the content of a node-wide Group Table that is part of the underlying interaction layer.
   This is done for each endpoint.
   After creating the Group cluster with specific ``ID`` and ``Name``, a device gets its own IPv6 multicast address and is ready to receive groupcast commands.

   In this |matter_type|, the binding device can create a groupcast message and send it to the chosen IPv6 multicast address.
   This allows the binding device to control multiple bound devices simultaneously.

   .. note::
      Writing the groupcast table on the devices blocks sending unicast commands.
      If you want to return to the original state, perform a factory reset of the device.
