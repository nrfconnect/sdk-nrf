The following sections describe the various features of |thingy| apart from the ones on the :ref:`ug_nrf91_features` page.

Operating modes
***************

|thingy| contains RGB indicator LEDs, which indicate the operating state of the device as described in the :ref:`LED indication <led_indication>` section of the :ref:`asset_tracker_v2_ui_module`.

GNSS
****

|thingy| has a GNSS receiver, which, if activated, allows the device to be located globally using GNSS signals.
In the :ref:`asset_tracker_v2` application, GNSS is activated by default.

LTE Band Lock
*************

For |thingy|, you can configure the modem to use specific LTE bands by using the band lock AT command.
See :ref:`nrf9160_ug_band_lock` and the |band_lock| for additional information.
The preprogrammed firmware configures the modem to use the bands currently certified on the |thingy| hardware.
When building the firmware, you can configure which bands must be enabled.

LTE-M / NB-IoT switching
************************

|thingy| has a multimode modem that enables it to support automatic switching between LTE-M and NB-IoT.
A built-in parameter in the |thingy| firmware determines whether the modem first attempts to connect in LTE-M or NB-IoT mode.
If the modem fails to connect using this preferred mode within the default timeout period (10 minutes), it switches to the other mode.
