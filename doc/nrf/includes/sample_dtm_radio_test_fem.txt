You can add support for the nRF21540 or nRF2220 front-end module (FEM) to the sample.

To add support for the FEM, build the sample for a board containing FEM like :ref:`nRF21540 DK/nRF52840 <zephyr:nrf21540dk_nrf52840>` or create a devicetree overlay file describing how FEM is connected to the nRF52 Series SoC in your device.

.. note::
   If you use the nRF21540 EK, append ``nrf21540ek`` shield to your build command instructing build system to append the appropriate devicetree overlay file.
   If you use the nRF2220 EK, append the ``nrf2220ek`` shield to your build command instructing the build system to append the appropriate devicetree overlay file.
   If you use the nRF21540 DK, build your application for the :ref:`nrf21540dk/nrf52840 <zephyr:nrf21540dk_nrf52840>` board target.
   The devicetree for the nRF21540 DK already contains the required FEM configuration, so you do not need to set an additional build option.

For example, to build the sample from the command line for an nRF5340 DK with an attached nRF21540 EK, invoke the following command within the sample directory:

.. code-block:: console

  west build -b nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpunet -- -DSHIELD=nrf21540ek
