.. note::
   The `Fast Pair Find My Device Network extension`_ has been renamed to the Find Hub Network (FHN) extension, and the `Find My Device app`_ is now called the Find Hub app.
   However, this documentation page still uses the previous terminology.
   The naming will be updated in the future releases.
