1. Open |VSC|.

   If you installed the |NCS| using the :ref:`gs_app_tcm`, you can click the :guilabel:`Open VS Code` button next to the version you installed.

#. Open the |nRFVSC| by clicking its icon or pressing ``Ctrl`` + ``Alt`` + ``N``.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Add an existing application` from the :guilabel:`Welcome View`.
#. In the prompt, navigate to the folder containing the sample or application you want to build, such as |sample_path_vsc|.

   Samples are located under :file:`nrf/samples/`, and applications are located under :file:`nrf/applications/`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Select folder` to select the sample's or the application's folder.

   A new application is automatically added in the :guilabel:`Applications View`.

#. If needed, click :guilabel:`Yes` when prompted if you trust the authors of the files.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Add Build Configuration` button in the :guilabel:`Application View`, or click the text stating :guilabel:`No build configurations. Click to create one`.

   This opens the :guilabel:`Add Build Configuration` screen.

#. Select the board onto which you want to program the sample.
   In this case, |vsc_sample_board_target_line|.
#. Select the :guilabel:`Build after generating configuration` checkbox and click the :guilabel:`Build Configuration` button.

   This generates the configuration file and triggers the build process.
   When the process is complete, the :guilabel:`Actions View` appears.
   In this View, you can trigger the build process again, flash the built sample, or start a debug session.
