Setting up an AWS S3 bucket
===========================

The firmware files for download must be stored in a bucket on an AWS S3 server.
To do this, set up your own bucket.

When setting up your own bucket, make sure to configure the permissions as shown in the following screenshot:

To update the permissions for an existing bucket, select your bucket and navigate to **Permissions** > **Block public access**.

In addition to the permissions, you must configure a bucket policy.
To determine a suitable security scheme for your application, see `AWS S3 Developer Guide: Using Bucket Policies and User Policies`_ and `AWS S3 Developer Guide: Bucket Policy Examples`_.
To configure the policy, select your bucket and navigate to **Permissions** > **Bucket Policy**.

For testing purposes, you can use the following, very permissive, bucket policy (replace *bucket_name* with the name of your bucket):

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   {    "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*bucket_name*/\*"
            }
         ]
    }
