When built for a board target with the ``*/ns`` :ref:`variant <app_boards_names>`, the sample is configured to compile and run as a non-secure application with :ref:`Cortex-M Security Extensions enabled <app_boards_spe_nspe_cpuapp_ns>`.
Therefore, it automatically includes :ref:`Trusted Firmware-M <ug_tfm>` that prepares the required peripherals and secure services to be available for the application.
