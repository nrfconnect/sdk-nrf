Complete the :ref:`command-line build setup <build_environment_cli>` before you start building |NCS| projects on the command line.

To build and program the source code from the command line, complete the following steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
#. Go to the specific sample or application directory.
   For example, the folder path is :file:`ncs/nrf/applications/asset_tracker_v2` when building the source code for the :ref:`asset_tracker_v2` application |cmd_folder_path|.

#. Make sure that you have the required version of the |NCS| repository by pulling the |NCS| repository, `sdk-nrf`_ on GitHub using the procedures described in :ref:`dm-wf-get-ncs` and :ref:`dm-wf-update-ncs`.

#. To get the rest of the dependencies, run the ``west update`` command as follows:

   .. code-block:: console

      west update

#. To build the sample or application code, run the ``west build`` command as follows:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      west build -b *build_target*

   The parameter *build_target* must be |cmd_build_target|.

   .. note::

      The parameter *destination_directory_name* can be used to optionally specify the destination directory in the west command.
      Unless a *destination_directory_name* is specified, the build files are automatically generated in :file:`build/zephyr/`.
