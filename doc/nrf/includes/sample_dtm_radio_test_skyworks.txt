The Skyworks SKY66114 and SKY66403 are front-end module (FEM) devices that support the 2-pin PA/LNA interface.
You can also use other Skyworks FEM devices that provide the same hardware interface.

To use the generic FEM implementation with Skyworks front-end modules refer to :ref:`ug_radio_fem_skyworks` for details.

Use case of incomplete physical connections to the FEM module
-------------------------------------------------------------

The devicetree configuration allows you to use a minimal pin configuration.
Connect all unused pins to the fixed logic level as instructed in the official documentation.
For example, ``csd-gpios`` is an optional pin that sets the device into sleep mode.
If this pin is not controlled by the driver, it must be connected to the fixed logic level.
