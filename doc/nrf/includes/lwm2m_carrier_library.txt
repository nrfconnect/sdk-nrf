The application supports the |NCS| :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library that you can use to connect to the operator's device management platform.
See the library's documentation for more information and configuration options.

To enable the LwM2M carrier library, add the parameter ``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-carrier.conf`` to your build command.

The CA root certificates that are needed for modem FOTA are not provisioned in the |application_sample_name|.
You can flash the :ref:`lwm2m_carrier` sample to write the certificates to modem before flashing the |application_sample_name|, or use the :ref:`at_client_sample` sample as explained in :ref:`preparing the Cellular: LwM2M Client sample for production <lwm2m_client_provisioning>`.
It is also possible to modify the |application_sample_name| project itself to include the certificate provisioning, as demonstrated in the :ref:`lwm2m_carrier` sample.
