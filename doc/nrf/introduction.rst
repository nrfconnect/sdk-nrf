About the |NCS|
###############

The |NCS| is hosted, distributed, and supported by Nordic Semiconductor for product development with Nordic SoCs.
The SDK is distributed in multiple Git repositories with application code, drivers, re-distributable libraries, and forks of open-source code used in the SDK.

The main repository is the ``nrf`` repository, which contains application and sample projects as well as the SDK manifest file that enables the repositories to be managed as one code base with the west tool.

See :ref:`getting_started` for information about how to install the |NCS| and about the first steps.
