MCUboot documentation
#####################

This documentation is based on the official `MCUboot <https://mcuboot.com>`_ documentation, but focuses on the use of MCUboot in the nRF Connect SDK.

The documentation includes documentation files from the upstream `MCUboot repository <https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot>`_.
Topics that are not relevant for the integration of MCUboot in the nRF Connect SDK are excluded from the navigation.

:ref:`mcuboot_ncs` contains information that is relevant for the `fork of MCUboot <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-mcuboot>`_ included in the nRF Connect SDK but not for the upstream MCUboot repository.
