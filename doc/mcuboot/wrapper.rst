MCUboot documentation
#####################

This documentation is based on the official `MCUboot <https://mcuboot.com>`_ documentation, but focuses on the use of MCUboot in nRF Connect SDK.

The documentation includes documentation files from the upstream `MCUboot repository <https://github.com/JuulLabs-OSS/mcuboot>`_.
Topics that are not relevant for the integration of MCUboot in the nRF Connect SDK are excluded from the navigation.

:ref:`mcuboot_ncs` contains information that is relevant for nRF Connect SDK's `fork of MCUboot <https://github.com/NordicPlayground/fw-nrfconnect-mcuboot>`_ but not for the upstream MCUboot repository.
