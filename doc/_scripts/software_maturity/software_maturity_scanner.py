NCS Software Maturity Level Scanner
===================================

This script can be used to generate a software maturity level report based
on experimental warnings in the build output and parsing Kconfig files.

The script requires three inputs to be functional:
- The twister output directory. This directory is searched for build.log files
  in which the experimental warnings appear. It is also searched for .config
  files to find relevant enabled Kconfig symbols.
- An Azure access key, to write the generated report to Azure blob storage.
- A YAML file describing all the desired features and their respective Kconfig
  rules. The file should contain a field for all the desired technologies
  listed in the top-level table, and then a field for all features within each
  technology.

  The Kconfig rules listed in the file can cosist of one or more Kconfig
  symbols, related with '&&' (indicating that all symbols must be present) or
  '||' (indicating that at least one of the symbols must be present). && has a
  higher precedence than ||, so  A || B && C is equivalent to A || (B && C).
  Parenthesis can also be used to form rules like (A || B && (C || D)) && E.
  Finally, a symbol can be negated with '!', indicating that the symbol must
  not be present. Only symbols can be negated, not entire expressions.

  Specific values for symbols can be given with '=', e.g. A=2. When no specific
  value is given, a symbol is automatically expanded to A=y. Negating a symbol
  with a value allows all occurrences of the symbol where the value differs
  from the given value.

  In cases where a feature is dependent on a companion chip to work, the feature
  entry can be expanded to a dictionary containing the fields "rule" and
  "boards_and_shields" where "rule" is the original KConfig rule and
  "boards_and_shields" is a list of KConfig options indicating that the
  required companion chip is present. If at least one sample is found
  where none of the listed companion chip options are present, the feature
  is marked as independent of the companion chips for the given SoC. Otherwise
  all found companion chip options are added as a footnote.

  One such file might look like this:

    top_table:
        Bluetooth: BT_CTLR
        Zigbee: ZIGBEE
        Thread: NET_L2_OPENTHREAD
        LTE: LTE_LINK_CONTROL
    features:
        bluetooth:
            LLPM: CAF_BLE_USE_LLPM
            Periodic Advertisement: BT_CTLR_SYNC_PERIODIC
        matter:
            Matter commissioning over IP: CHIP
            Matter over Thread: CHIP && NET_L2_OPENTHREAD
        wifi:
            STA Mode:
                rule: WPA_SUPP && WIFI_NRF700X
                boards_and_shields:
                  - SHIELD_NRF7002EK
                  - BOARD_NRF7002DK_NRF5340_CPUAPP

If no input file is specified, the script will look in the local directory for
a 'software_maturity_features.yaml' file.

The ``TWISTER_OUT_DIR`` environment variable is used by default to provide the
necessary input folder. It can be overwritten by supplying the
``--build-output`` option.

The Azure access key can be supplied with the argument ``--access-key``.
If not provided as an argument explicitly, the environment variable
``AZURE_REPORT_CACHE_ACCESS_KEY`` is used by default.

Publish Results/Run Locally
***************************
The script can run in two different modes, based on which of the following
options are supplied: ``--save-output`` or ``--publish-results``.

When ``--save-output`` is used, no Azure access keys are needed, and the
results are written to the specified file on the local filesystem.

When run with the ``--publish-results``, the script will run as normal, and
upload the resulting YAML file to Azure blob storage. This should ONLY be
done by the CI build system. To differentiate the results of different runs,
use the ``--commit-sha`` option upon execution to mark the commit on which the
build output is based.

Script Logic
************

A complete list of all available SoCs are found by searching through the
samples and applications folder for sample.yaml files and retrieving the
``integration_platforms`` list from each. Anything nRF51 and not starting with
nRF is excluded.

To mark features as experimental the twister output folder is searched for
all build.log files and scanned for the string "Experimental symbol XXX is
enabled". When found, The SoC is looked up in /zephyr/.config, and a mapping
from each SoC to the experimental symbols detected when using it to build is
stored and used to evaluate the Kconfig rules.

Next, the twister output folder is searched for all .config-files. These
are evaluated against the given Kconfig rules to determine which features
are supported, experimental or not supported. If a rule contains multiple
symbols connected with either && or ||, all of the symbols must be present in
the same .config-file for a SoC to be registered as supporting that feature.
That means that a feature is not marked as supported if there is no explicit
test case where all the required Kconfig symbols are present at the same time,
even if the required options have been enabled individually in separate
samples. If at least one of the symbols are marked as experimental, the feature
is also marked as experimental.

In cases where there are rules with multiple symbols connected with ||, and one
is experimental and the others are not, the feature will still be marked as
experimental. If this is an undesired outcome, the feature should be split
into two separate features, one with the experimental symbols and the other
with the supported ones.
