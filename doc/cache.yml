# Documentation build cache configuration file.
#
# The way each NCS docset is built may differ depending on the origin of the
# sources. Some docsets have all content in this repository, others import the
# content and some others are a combination of both. This information is
# required for the cache utility in order to obtain the correct versions.
#
# File format:
#
# - docset: $DOCSET_NAME
#   projects:
#      - $PROJECT0
#      - ...
#      - $PROJECTN
#
# where $DOCSET_NAME is the docset name (same as used in the build system) and
# $PROJECT0..N are projects containing the docset documentation sources. Project
# names need to match with what is listed on the manifest. Note that 'manifest'
# means the manifest project itself.
