The nRF Peripheral Sensor node is an application that periodically acquires data from a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and Two-wire Interface (TWI) devices.
It advertises and enables the reading of sensor values from a BluetoothÂ® service in a power-efficient way.
The application performs burst measurements periodically and in response to IMU interrupts.
The measured data is stored in the non-volatile memory (NVM) and can be retrieved through Bluetooth.
The application holds a number of measurements depending on the size of memory allocated for storage.
New data automatically replaces the oldest records.

Application Overview
********************

To perform its tasks, the nRF Peripheral Sensor node application uses components available in Zephyr and the |NCS|.
These include the :ref:`lib_caf` modules and :ref:`zephyr:sensor_api` for sampling sensors, :ref:`nsms_readme` for presenting measured data, and a dedicated service for historical data retrieval over Bluetooth LE.
The application also stores measurements in a dedicated non-volatile memory partition.
You can download the stored data over Bluetooth.

Sampling sensors
================

The application handles the sensor sampling using the Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:sensor_api`.
This approach allows it to use any sensor available in Zephyr.

By default, you need to use the :ref:`peripheral_sensor_node_shield` for this application.

Power management
================

To reduce power consumption, the Peripheral Sensor node application mostly remains in the power-down state.
The application periodically performs burst measurement of the environmental and IMU sensors at specified intervals and does additional burst measurement when triggered by the interrupt from the `ADXL362`_ sensor.
You can configure the intervals for periodic burst measurement through the :ref:`CONFIG_APP_CONTROL_BURST_INTERVAL_S <CONFIG_APP_CONTROL_BURST_INTERVAL_S>` Kconfig option.
By default, the burst interval is set to 120 seconds.
You can also configure the number of measurements for a single burst using the :ref:`CONFIG_APP_CONTROL_BURST_MEAS_CNT <CONFIG_APP_CONTROL_BURST_MEAS_CNT>` Kconfig option.
The time interval between measurements is specified in the :ref:`CONFIG_APP_CONTROL_BURST_MEAS_INTERVAL_MS <CONFIG_APP_CONTROL_BURST_MEAS_INTERVAL_MS>` Kconfig option.

When the application performs burst measurements, it also starts advertising.
This means it can be connected through a Bluetooth central device, for example, the `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ application on your smartphone or tablet.

Firmware architecture
=====================

The nRF Peripheral Sensor node application has a modular structure, where each module has a defined scope of responsibilities.
The application uses the :ref:`app_event_manager` to distribute events between modules in the system.

The following figure shows the application architecture and visualizes relations between Application Event Manager, modules, drivers, and libraries.

Requirements
************

The application supports the following development kit:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

User interface
**************

LED 1:
   The LED is lit when the application is active.

You can interact with the application by using the logging system and Bluetooth application described in the :ref:`nrf_peripheral_sensor_node_app_testing` section.

Configuration
*************

The nRF Peripheral Sensor node application is modular and event-driven.
You can enable and configure the modules separately for the selected board and build type.
See the :ref:`lib_caf` documentation for more information.

Configuration options
=====================

Check and configure the following Kconfig options:

.. _CONFIG_APP_CONTROL_BURST_INTERVAL_S:

CONFIG_APP_CONTROL_BURST_INTERVAL_S
   The application configuration sets the time interval in seconds for burst data acquisitions from sensors.
   If sensor data burst is not triggered by :c:struct:`wake_up_event` from IMU, burst is performed at each interval.

.. _CONFIG_APP_CONTROL_BURST_MEAS_CNT:

CONFIG_APP_CONTROL_BURST_MEAS_CNT
   The application configuration specifies the number of measurements a single burst acquires before going to sleep.
   The default value is ``10``.

.. _CONFIG_APP_CONTROL_BURST_MEAS_INTERVAL_MS:

CONFIG_APP_CONTROL_BURST_MEAS_INTERVAL_MS
   The application configuration specifies the time interval between measurements for a single burst.
   The default value is 1000 ms.

Configuration files
===================

The nRF Peripheral Sensor node application uses both the :ref:`standard configuration files common to Zephyr and the |NCS| <app_build_system>` and the application-specific :file:`_def` files, which contain configuration arrays for the application modules.
The :file:`_def` files are used by the nRF Peripheral Sensor node application modules and :ref:`lib_caf` modules.

Configuration files are defined in the :file:`applications/peripheral_sensor_node/configuration/nrf54l15dk_nrf54l15_cpuapp` directory.

Advertising configuration
-------------------------

If a given build type enables Bluetooth, the :ref:`caf_ble_adv` is used to control the Bluetooth advertising.
This CAF module relies on :ref:`bt_le_adv_prov_readme` to manage advertising data and to scan response data.
The nRF Peripheral Sensor node application configures the data providers in the :file:`src/util/Kconfig` file.
By default, the application enables a set of data providers available in the |NCS|.
If the Noridc UART Service (NUS) is enabled in the configuration, and the Bluetooth local identity in use has no bond, the application also adds a custom provider that appends UUID128 of NUS to the scan response data.

Shield Configuration
====================

To ensure that the measurement is triggered by an interrupt from the ADXL362 sensor, you need to set a jumper on the shield board.
Place a jumper on header **P3** to connect the ``IRQ_U3`` signal.
This configuration allows the application to respond to interrupts generated by the sensor.

Building and running
********************

.. |application path| replace:: :file:`applications/peripheral_sensor_node`

.. include:: /includes/application_build_and_run.txt

Building with PCA63565
======================

To build for the PCA63565 shield, build with the CMake ``SHIELD`` option set to ``pca63565``.
See :ref:`cmake_options` for instructions on how to provide CMake options.

For example, if you build on the command line, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf54l15pdk/nrf54l15/cpuapp -- -DSHIELD=pca63565

Alternatively, you can use the :ref:`Twister test case <running_unit_tests>` by running the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf54l15pdk/nrf54l15/cpuapp -T applications.peripheral_sensor_node .

.. _nrf_peripheral_sensor_node_app_testing:

Testing with the PDK
====================

After programming the application, perform the following steps to test the nRF Peripheral Sensor node application on the Preview Development Kit (PDK):

1. Turn on the PDK.
   The application starts Bluetooth advertising.
#. Start the `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ application on your smartphone or tablet.
#. Connect to the device from the application.
   When connected, go to :guilabel:`...` and click :guilabel:`Request MTU`.
   Set the value to ``498``.
   The device is advertising as ``Peripheral Sensor Node``.
   You will see services of the connected device.

   .. note::
      If the device cannot be found, the PDK might be connected to another device.
      Terminate the connection with the other device, refresh the scanning and connect to the PDK.
      The bonding data can be erased by running the :ref:`standard programming command <programming>`.``

#. Find the ``Env read`` charateristic (UUID ``de550004-acb6-4c73-8445-2563acbb43c2``).
#. Enable notification for this characteristic.
#. Find ``Env read req`` charateristic (UUID ``de550002-acb6-4c73-8445-2563acbb43c2``).
#. Write to ``Env read req`` a number of requested history depth as little endian uint16_t.
#. Observe the returned data in ``Env read``.
#. See the latest measurement results of IMU and environmental sensors through a separate **Nordic Status Message Service** characteristics.

Application logs
================

The application provides logs through the UART of the PDK.
To observe the logs, connect to the development kit with a terminal emulator, for example `nRF Connect Serial Terminal`_.
See :ref:`serial_terminal_connect` for the required settings.

Application internal modules
****************************

The nRF Peripheral Sensor node application uses modules available in :ref:`lib_caf` (CAF), a set of generic modules based on Application Event Manager and available to all applications, and a set of dedicated internal modules.
See `Firmware architecture`_ for more information.

The nRF Peripheral Sensor node application uses the following modules available in CAF:

* :ref:`caf_ble_adv`
* :ref:`caf_ble_state`
* :ref:`caf_settings_loader`
* :ref:`caf_leds`

See the module pages for more information about the modules and their configuration.

The nRF Peripheral Sensor node application also uses the following dedicated application modules:

``app_control``
  The module controls the state of the application.
  It periodically schedules burst measurements if the burst is not triggered by the ADXL362 trigger.

``sensors``
  The module uses Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:sensor_api` to handle the sampling and sensor management.

  The module generates the following types of events in relation with the sensor defined in the module configuration file:

  * :c:struct:`sensor_event` when the sensor is sampled.
  * :c:struct:`sensor_state_event` when the sensor state changes.
  * :c:struct:`wake_up_event` when the ADXL362 trigger activates.

  The module is controlled with the following types of events:

  * :c:struct:`sensor_start_event` starts sampling of the desired sensor.
  * :c:struct:`sensor_stop_event` stops sampling of the desired sensor.
  * :c:struct:`power_down_event` enables trigger of the ADXL362.

``env_history``
  The module captures sensor events.
  In case the event contains environmental sensor data, the module prepares ``struct env_storage_chunk`` and requests the non-volatile storage (NVS) write operation.
  NVS partition configured for this module has 12 sectors, 4 kB each.
  When write is requested and there is not enough memory, NVS erases the oldest sector, and write is performed as usual.
  The recorded chunk contains ID of 32 bits, which is incremented each time.
  Chunks can be accessed through the Bluetooth characteristics as described in the :ref:`nrf_peripheral_sensor_node_app_testing` section.

Dependencies
************

The application uses the following Zephyr drivers and libraries:

* :ref:`zephyr:sensor_api`
* :ref:`zephyr:uart_api`

The application uses the following |NCS| libraries and drivers:

* :ref:`app_event_manager`
* :ref:`lib_caf`
* :ref:`nus_service_readme`
