	  If enabled, NMEA messages that pertain to the satellites will be output
	  along with the other NMEA messages. Those are output in debug logs, and
	  can also be output to a dedicated CMUX channel.

	  If enabled, when a fix is acquired the current location and time will
	  be passed to the P-GPS subsystem.
	  It allows to speed up the time it takes to acquire the next fix when
	  A-GNSS is disabled or unavailable.
	  This can be detrimental to short TTFF if the device is expected to move
	  distances longer than a few dozen kilometers between fix attempts.
	  In that case this option should be disabled.
