The Serial LTE Modem (SLM) application demonstrates how to use an nRF91 Series device as a stand-alone LTE modem that can be controlled by AT commands.

Overview
********

The nRF91 Series SiP integrates both a full LTE modem and an application MCU, enabling you to run your LTE application directly on the device.

However, if you want to run your application on a different chip and use the nRF91 Series device only as a modem, the serial LTE modem application provides you with an interface for controlling the LTE modem through AT commands.

The application accepts both the modem-specific AT commands and proprietary AT commands.
The AT commands are documented in the following guides:

* Modem-specific AT commands - `nRF91x1 AT Commands Reference Guide`_  and `nRF9160 AT Commands Reference Guide`_
* Proprietary AT commands - :ref:`SLM_AT_intro`

Requirements

Additional configuration
========================

To save power, both the console and the output logs over ``UART_0`` are disabled in this application.
This information is logged using RTT instead.
See :ref:`testing_rtt_connect` for instructions on how to view this information.

To switch to UART output, change the following options in the :file:`prj.conf` file::

   # Segger RTT
   CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT=n
   CONFIG_RTT_CONSOLE=n
   CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE=y
   CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_RTT=n
   CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_UART=y


Configuration files
===================

The sample provides predefined configuration files for both the parent image and the child image.
You can find the configuration files in the :file:`applications/serial_lte_modem` directory.

The following configuration files are provided:

* :file:`prj.conf` - This configuration file contains the standard configuration for the serial LTE modem application.

* :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` - This configuration file contains additional configuration options that are required to use :ref:`slm_native_tls`.
  You can include it by adding ``-DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-native_tls.conf`` to your build command.
  See :ref:`cmake_options`.

* :file:`overlay-carrier.conf` - Configuration file that adds |NCS| :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` support.
  See :ref:`slm_carrier_library_support` for more information on how to connect to an operator's device management platform.

* :file:`overlay-full_fota.conf` - Configuration file that adds full modem FOTA support.
  See :ref:`SLM_AT_FOTA` for more information on how to use full modem FOTA functionality.

* :file:`boards/nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns.conf` - Configuration file specific for the nRF9160 DK.
  This file is automatically merged with the :file:`prj.conf` file when you build for the ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns`` build target.

* :file:`boards/nrf9161dk_nrf9161_ns.conf` - Configuration file specific for the nRF9161 DK.
  This file is automatically merged with the :file:`prj.conf` file when you build for the ``nrf9161dk_nrf9161_ns`` build target.

* :file:`boards/thingy91_nrf9160_ns.conf` - Configuration file specific for Thingy:91.
  This file is automatically merged with the :file:`prj.conf` file when you build for the ``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` build target.

In general, Kconfig overlays have an ``overlay-`` prefix and a :file:`.conf` extension.
Board-specific configuration files are named :file:`<BOARD>.conf` and are located in the :file:`boards` folder.
DTS overlay files are named as the build target they are meant to be used with, and use the file extension :file:`.overlay`.
They are also placed in the :file:`boards` folder.
When the DTS overlay filename matches the build target, the overlay is automatically chosen and applied by the build system.

See :ref:`app_build_system`: for more information on the |NCS| configuration system.

.. _slm_native_tls:

Native TLS
----------

By default, the secure socket (TLS/DTLS) is offloaded onto the modem.
However, if you need customized TLS/DTLS features that are not supported by the modem firmware, you can use native TLS instead.
Currently, the SLM application can be built to use native TLS for the following services:

* Secure socket
* TLS Proxy server
* HTTPS client

If native TLS is enabled, you must use the ``AT#XCMNG`` command to store the credentials.

.. note::

   The modem needs to be in an offline state when storing the credentials.
   The SLM application supports security tags ranging from ``0`` to ``214748364``.

The configuration options that are required to enable the native TLS socket are defined in the :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` file.

.. note::

   Native TLS sockets have the following limitations:

   * PSK, PSK identity, and PSK public key are currently not supported.
   * The DTLS server is currently not supported.
   * TLS session resumption is currently not supported.

.. _slm_connecting_91dk:

Communicating with the modem on an nRF91 Series DK
==================================================

In this scenario, an nRF91 Series DK running the Serial LTE Modem application serves as the host.
You can use either a PC or an external MCU as a client.

.. _slm_connecting_91dk_pc:

Connecting with a PC
--------------------

To connect to an nRF91 Series DK with a PC:

.. slm_connecting_91dk_pc_instr_start

1. Verify that ``UART_0`` is selected in the application.
   It is defined in the default configuration.

2. Use `nRF Connect Serial Terminal`_ to connect to the development kit.
   See :ref:`serial_terminal_connect` for instructions.
   You can also use the :guilabel:`Open Serial Terminal` option of the `Cellular Monitor`_ app to open the Serial Terminal.
   Using the Cellular Monitor app in combination with the nRF Connect Serial Terminal shows how the modem responds to the different modem commands.
   You can then use this connection to send or receive AT commands over UART, and to see the log output of the development kit.

   Alternatively, you can use a terminal emulator like `Termite`_, `Teraterm`_, or PuTTY to establish a terminal connection to the development kit, using the following settings:

   * Baud rate: 115200
   * 8 data bits
   * 1 stop bit
   * No parity
   * HW flow control: None

   .. note::

      The default AT command terminator is a carriage return followed by a line feed (``\r\n``).
      nRF Connect Serial Terminal supports this format.
      If you want to use another terminal emulator, make sure that the configured AT command terminator corresponds to the line terminator of your terminal.

      When using `Termite`_ and `Teraterm`_, configure the AT command terminator as follows:

      .. figure:: images/termite.svg
         :alt: Termite configuration for sending AT commands through UART

      .. figure:: images/teraterm.svg
         :alt: Teraterm configuration for sending AT commands through UART

      When using PuTTY, you must set the :ref:`CONFIG_SLM_CR_TERMINATION <CONFIG_SLM_CR_TERMINATION>` SLM configuration option instead.
      See :ref:`application configuration <slm_config>` for more details.

.. _slm_connecting_91dk_mcu:

Connecting with an external MCU
-------------------------------

.. note::

   This section does not apply to Thingy:91 as it does not have UART2.

If you run your user application on an external MCU (for example, an nRF52 Series development kit), you can control the modem on an nRF91 Series device directly from the application.
See the :ref:`slm_shell_sample` for a sample implementation of such an application.

To connect with an external MCU using UART_2, change the configuration files for the default board as follows:

.. note::
   The GPIO output level on the nRF91 Series device side must be 3 V.
   You can set the VDD voltage with the **VDD IO** switch (**SW9**).
   See the `VDD supply rail section in the nRF9160 DK User Guide`_ for more information related to nRF9160 DK.

.. _slm_connecting_thingy91:

Communicating with the modem on Thingy:91
=========================================

In this scenario, Thingy:91 running the Serial LTE Modem application serves as the host.
You can use only a PC as a client.

.. _slm_connecting_thingy91_pc:

Connecting with a PC
--------------------

To connect to Thingy:91 with a PC, you must first program the :ref:`connectivity_bridge` on the nrf52840 of Thingy:91.
It routes ``UART_0`` to ``USB_CDC0`` on Thingy:91.
By enabling the option ``CONFIG_BRIDGE_BLE_ENABLE`` , you can also use SLM over :ref:`nus_service_readme`.

Then follow the instructions below:

.. include:: slm_description.rst
   :start-after: .. slm_connecting_91dk_pc_instr_start
   :end-before: .. slm_connecting_91dk_pc_instr_end

You can also test the i2c sensor on Thingy:91 using :ref:`SLM_AT_TWI`.
See :ref:`slm_testing_twi` for more details.

.. _slm_testing_section:

Testing
=======

The following testing instructions focus on testing the application with a PC client.
If you have an nRF52 Series DK running a client application, you can also use this DK for testing the different scenarios.

|test_sample|

1. |connect_kit|
#. :ref:`Connect to the kit with nRF Connect Serial Terminal <serial_terminal_connect>`.
   You can also use the :guilabel:`Open Serial Terminal` option of the `Cellular Monitor`_ app to open the Serial Terminal.
   If you want to use a different terminal emulator, see :ref:`slm_connecting_91dk_pc`.
#. Reset the kit.
#. Observe that the development kit sends a ``Ready\r\n`` message on UART.
#. Send AT commands and observe the responses from the development kit.

   See :ref:`slm_testing` for typical test cases.

.. _slm_carrier_library_support:

Using the LwM2M carrier library
===============================

.. |application_sample_name| replace:: Serial LTE Modem application

.. include:: /includes/lwm2m_carrier_library.txt

The certificate provisioning can also be done directly in the Serial LTE Modem application by using the same AT commands as described for the :ref:`at_client_sample` sample.

Enabling the LwM2M carrier library will disable this application's support for GNSS in order to have enough space in flash.
