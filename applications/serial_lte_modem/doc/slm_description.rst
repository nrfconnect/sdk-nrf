The Serial LTE Modem (SLM) application demonstrates how to use an nRF91 Series device as a stand-alone LTE modem that can be controlled by AT commands.

Overview
********

The nRF91 Series SiP integrates both a full LTE modem and an application MCU, enabling you to run your LTE application directly on the device.

However, if you want to run your application on a different chip and use the nRF91 Series device only as a modem, the serial LTE modem application provides you with an interface for controlling the LTE modem through AT commands.

The application accepts both the modem-specific AT commands and proprietary AT commands.
The AT commands are documented in the following guides:

* Modem-specific AT commands - `nRF91x1 AT Commands Reference Guide`_  and `nRF9160 AT Commands Reference Guide`_
* Proprietary AT commands - :ref:`SLM_AT_commands`

Requirements
************

The application supports the following development kits:

   This option is enabled by the PPP overlay.
   It adds support for PPP.
   PPP can be used in conjunction with :ref:`CMUX <CONFIG_SLM_CMUX>` in order to use a single UART for both AT data and PPP.
   When CMUX is also enabled, PPP is usable only through a CMUX channel.
   See :ref:`SLM_AT_PPP` for more information.

.. _CONFIG_SLM_NATIVE_TLS:

CONFIG_SLM_NATIVE_TLS - Use Zephyr's Mbed TLS for TLS connections
   This option is enabled by the native TLS overlay.

   .. note::
      This pin is configured with a pull up, so it is active low.
      It must be pulled down for a short time to perform one power off or wake up operation.

.. _CONFIG_SLM_INDICATE_PIN:

CONFIG_SLM_INDICATE_PIN - Interface GPIO pin to indicate data available or unsolicited event notifications
   This option specifies which pin to use for indicating data available or unsolicited event notifications from the modem.
   It is set by default as follows:

   CONFIG_RTT_CONSOLE=n
   CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE=y
   CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_RTT=n
   CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_UART=y

.. _slm_config_files:

Configuration files
===================

You can find the configuration files in the :file:`applications/serial_lte_modem` directory.

In general, they have an ``overlay-`` prefix, and a :file:`.conf` or :file:`.overlay` extension for Kconfig or devicetree overlays, respectively.
Board-specific configuration files are named :file:`<BOARD>` with a :file:`.conf` or :file:`.overlay` extension and are located in the :file:`boards` directory.
When the name of the board-specific configuration file matches the build target, the overlay is automatically included by the build system.

See :ref:`app_build_system`: for more information on the |NCS| configuration system.

.. important::

  When adding Kconfig fragments and devicetree overlays, make sure to use the ``-DEXTRA_CONF_FILE`` and ``-DEXTRA_DTC_OVERLAY_FILE`` CMake parameters, respectively.
  Otherwise, if ``-DCONF_FILE`` or ``-DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE`` is used, all the configuration files that normally get picked up automatically will have to be included explicitly.

The following configuration files are provided:

* :file:`prj.conf` - This configuration file contains the standard configuration for the serial LTE modem application and is included by default by the build system.

* :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` - This configuration file contains additional configuration options that are required to use :ref:`slm_native_tls`.
  You can include it by adding ``-DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-native_tls.conf`` to your build command.
  See :ref:`cmake_options`.

* :file:`overlay-carrier.conf` - Configuration file that adds |NCS| :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` support.
  See :ref:`slm_carrier_library_support` for more information on how to connect to an operator's device management platform.

* :file:`overlay-full_fota.conf` - Configuration file that adds full modem FOTA support.
  See :ref:`SLM_AT_FOTA` for more information on how to use full modem FOTA functionality.

* :file:`overlay-cmux.conf` - Configuration file that adds support for the CMUX protocol.
  See :ref:`SLM_AT_CMUX` for more information.

* :file:`overlay-ppp.conf` - Configuration file that adds support for the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).
  This disables most of the IP-based protocols available through AT commands (such as FTP and MQTT) as it is expected that the controlling chip's own IP stack is used instead.
  See :ref:`CONFIG_SLM_PPP <CONFIG_SLM_PPP>` and :ref:`SLM_AT_PPP` for more information.

* :file:`overlay-ppp-without-cmux.conf` - Kconfig fragment that configures the UART to be used by PPP.
  This configuration file should be included when building SLM with PPP and without CMUX.

* :file:`overlay-ppp-without-cmux.overlay` - Devicetree overlay that configures the UART to be used by PPP.
  This configuration file should be included when building SLM with PPP and without CMUX, in addition to :file:`overlay-ppp.conf`.
  It can be customized to fit your configuration (UART, baud rate, and so on).
  By default, it sets the baud rate of the PPP UART to 1 000 000.

* :file:`overlay-zephyr-modem.conf`, :file:`overlay-zephyr-modem-external-mcu.conf`, :file:`overlay-zephyr-modem-nrf9160dk-nrf52840.conf`, :file:`overlay-external-mcu.overlay`,  and :file:`overlay-zephyr-modem-nrf9160dk-nrf52840.overlay` - These configuration files are used when compiling SLM to turn an nRF91 Series SiP into a Zephyr-compatible standalone modem.
  See :ref:`slm_as_zephyr_modem` for more information.

* :file:`boards/nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns.conf` - Configuration file specific for the nRF9160 DK.
  This file is automatically merged with the :file:`prj.conf` file when you build for the ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns`` build target.

* :file:`boards/nrf9161dk_nrf9161_ns.conf` - Configuration file specific for the nRF9161 DK.
  This file is automatically merged with the :file:`prj.conf` file when you build for the ``nrf9161dk_nrf9161_ns`` build target.

* :file:`boards/thingy91_nrf9160_ns.conf` - Configuration file specific for Thingy:91.
  This file is automatically merged with the :file:`prj.conf` file when you build for the ``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` build target.

.. _slm_native_tls:

Native TLS
----------

By default, the secure socket (TLS) is offloaded to the modem.
If you need customized TLS features that are not supported by the modem firmware, you can use native TLS instead.
Native TLS uses the Mbed TLS library in Zephyr to establish secure connectivity.
Currently, the SLM application can be built to use native TLS for the following services:

* Secure socket
* TLS Proxy client
* TLS Proxy server
* HTTPS client

With native TLS, the credentials are stored in the Zephyr settings storage with the ``AT#XCMNG`` command.

The configuration options that are required to enable native TLS are defined in the :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` file.

.. note::

   Native TLS services have the following limitations:

   * TLS session resumption is currently not supported.

.. _slm_connecting_91dk:

Communicating with the modem on an nRF91 Series DK
==================================================

In this scenario, an nRF91 Series DK running the Serial LTE Modem application serves as the host.
You can use either a PC or an external MCU as a client.

.. _slm_connecting_91dk_pc:

Connecting with a PC
--------------------

To connect to an nRF91 Series DK with a PC:

.. slm_connecting_91dk_pc_instr_start

1. Verify that ``UART_0`` is selected in the application.
   It is defined in the default configuration.

2. Use `nRF Connect Serial Terminal`_ to connect to the development kit.
   See :ref:`serial_terminal_connect` for instructions.
   You can also use the :guilabel:`Open Serial Terminal` option of the `Cellular Monitor`_ app to open the Serial Terminal.
   Using the Cellular Monitor app in combination with the nRF Connect Serial Terminal shows how the modem responds to the different modem commands.
   You can then use this connection to send or receive AT commands over UART, and to see the log output of the development kit.

   Instead of using nRF Connect Serial Terminal, you can use PuTTY to establish a terminal connection to the development kit, using the :ref:`default serial port connection settings <test_and_optimize>`.

   .. note::

      The default AT command terminator is a carriage return followed by a line feed (``\r\n``).
      nRF Connect Serial Terminal supports this format.
      If you want to use another terminal emulator, make sure that the configured AT command terminator corresponds to the line terminator of your terminal.
      When using PuTTY, you must set the :ref:`CONFIG_SLM_CR_TERMINATION <CONFIG_SLM_CR_TERMINATION>` SLM configuration option.
      See :ref:`slm_config_options` for more details.

.. slm_connecting_91dk_pc_instr_end

.. _slm_connecting_91dk_mcu:

Connecting with an external MCU
-------------------------------

.. note::

   This section does not apply to Thingy:91 as it does not have UART2.

If you run your user application on an external MCU (for example, an nRF52 Series development kit), you can control the modem on an nRF91 Series device directly from the application.
See the :ref:`slm_shell_sample` for a sample implementation of such an application.

To connect with an external MCU using UART_2, change the configuration files for the default board as follows:

.. note::
   The GPIO output level on the nRF91 Series device side must be 3 V.
   You can set the VDD voltage with the **VDD IO** switch (**SW9**).
   See the `VDD supply rail section in the nRF9160 DK User Guide`_ for more information related to nRF9160 DK.

.. _slm_connecting_thingy91:

Communicating with the modem on Thingy:91
=========================================

In this scenario, Thingy:91 running the Serial LTE Modem application serves as the host.
You can use a PC as a client.

.. _slm_connecting_thingy91_pc:

Connecting with a PC
--------------------

The nRF52840 SoC of Thingy:91 is pre-programmed with the :ref:`connectivity_bridge` application.
To update the :ref:`connectivity_bridge` application, see the :ref:`programming_thingy` documentation.
The :ref:`connectivity_bridge` application routes ``UART_0`` to ``USB_CDC0`` on Thingy:91.
By enabling the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BRIDGE_BLE_ENABLE` Kconfig option in the :ref:`connectivity_bridge`, you can also use SLM over :ref:`nus_service_readme`.

To connect to a Thingy:91 with a PC:

.. include:: slm_description.rst
   :start-after: .. slm_connecting_91dk_pc_instr_start
   :end-before: .. slm_connecting_91dk_pc_instr_end

You can also test the i2c sensor on Thingy:91 using :ref:`SLM_AT_TWI`.
See :ref:`slm_testing_twi` for more details.

.. _slm_testing_section:

Testing
=======

The following testing instructions focus on testing the application with a PC client.
If you have an nRF52 Series DK running a client application, you can also use this DK for testing the different scenarios.

|test_sample|

1. |connect_kit|
#. :ref:`Connect to the kit with nRF Connect Serial Terminal <serial_terminal_connect>`.
   You can also use the :guilabel:`Open Serial Terminal` option of the `Cellular Monitor`_ app to open the Serial Terminal.
   If you want to use a different terminal emulator, see :ref:`slm_connecting_91dk_pc`.
#. Reset the kit.
#. Observe that the development kit sends a ``Ready\r\n`` message on UART.
#. Send AT commands and observe the responses from the development kit.

   See :ref:`slm_testing` for typical test cases.

.. _slm_carrier_library_support:

Using the LwM2M carrier library
===============================

.. |application_sample_name| replace:: Serial LTE Modem application

.. include:: /includes/lwm2m_carrier_library.txt

The certificate provisioning can also be done directly in the Serial LTE Modem application by using the same AT commands as described for the :ref:`at_client_sample` sample.

When the :ref:`liblwm2m_carrier_readme` library is in use, by default the application will auto-connect to the network on startup.
This behavior can be changed by disabling the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SLM_AUTO_CONNECT` option.

Dependencies
