The Serial LTE Modem (SLM) application demonstrates how to use the nRF9160 as a stand-alone LTE modem that can be controlled by AT commands.

Overview
********

The nRF9160 SiP integrates both a full LTE modem and an application MCU, enabling you to run your LTE application directly on the nRF9160.

However, if you want to run your application on a different chip and use the nRF9160 only as a modem, the serial LTE modem application provides you with an interface for controlling the LTE modem through AT commands.

The application accepts both the modem-specific AT commands documented in the `nRF91 AT Commands Reference Guide <AT Commands Reference Guide_>`_ and the proprietary AT commands documented in the :ref:`SLM_AT_intro` page.

Requirements
************

The application supports the following development kits:

Additional configuration
========================

To save power, both the console and the output logs over ``UART_0`` are disabled in this application.
This information is logged using RTT instead.
See :ref:`testing_rtt_connect` for instructions on how to view this information.

To switch to UART output, change the following options in the :file:`prj.conf` file::

   # Segger RTT
   CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT=n
   CONFIG_RTT_CONSOLE=n
   CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE=y
   CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_RTT=n
   CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_UART=y


Configuration files
===================

The sample provides predefined configuration files for both the parent image and the child image.
You can find the configuration files in the :file:`applications/serial_lte_modem` directory.

The following configuration files are provided:

* :file:`prj.conf` - This configuration file contains the standard configuration for the serial LTE modem application.

* :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` - This configuration file contains additional configuration options that are required to use :ref:`slm_native_tls`.
  You can include it by adding ``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-native_tls.conf`` to your build command.
  See :ref:`cmake_options`.

* :file:`overlay-secure_bootloader.conf` - This configuration file contains additional configuration options that are required to use :ref:`ug_bootloader`.
  You can include it by adding ``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-secure_bootloader`` to your build command.
  See :ref:`cmake_options`.

* :file:`boards/nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns.conf` - Configuration file specific for the nRF9160 DK.
  This file is automatically merged with the :file:`prj.conf` file when you build for the ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns`` build target.

* :file:`boards/thingy91_nrf9160_ns.conf` - Configuration file specific for Thingy:91.
  This file is automatically merged with the :file:`prj.conf` file when you build for the ``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` build target.

In general, Kconfig overlays have an ``overlay-`` prefix and a :file:`.conf` extension.
Board-specific configuration files are named :file:`<BOARD>.conf` and are located in the :file:`boards` folder.
DTS overlay files are named as the build target they are meant to be used with, and use the file extension :file:`.overlay`.
They are also placed in the :file:`boards` folder.
When the DTS overlay filename matches the build target, the overlay is automatically chosen and applied by the build system.

See :ref:`app_build_system`: for more information on the |NCS| configuration system.

.. _slm_native_tls:

Native TLS
----------

By default, the secure socket (TLS/DTLS) is offloaded onto the modem.
However, if you need customized TLS/DTLS features that are not supported by the modem firmware, you can use native TLS instead.
Currently, the SLM application can be built to use native TLS for the following services:

* Secure socket
* TLS Proxy server
* HTTPS client

If native TLS is enabled, you must use the ``AT#XCMNG`` command to store the credentials.

.. note::

   The modem needs to be in an offline state when storing the credentials.
   The SLM application supports security tags ranging from ``0`` to ``214748364``.

The configuration options that are required to enable the native TLS socket are defined in the :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` file.

.. note::

   The following limitations exist for native TLS sockets:

   * PSK, PSK identity, and PSK public key are currently not supported.
   * The DTLS server is currently not supported.
   * TLS session resumption is currently not supported.

.. include:: /includes/thingy91_build_and_run.txt

.. _slm_connecting_9160dk:

Communicating with the modem on the nRF9160 DK
==============================================

In this scenario, the nRF9160 DK running the Serial LTE Modem application serves as the host.
You can use either a PC or an external MCU as a client.

.. _slm_connecting_9160dk_pc:

Connecting with a PC
--------------------

To connect to the nRF9160 DK with a PC

.. slm_connecting_9160dk_pc_instr_start

1. Verify that :ref:`CONFIG_SLM_CONNECT_UART_0 <CONFIG_SLM_CONNECT_UART_0>` is defined in the application.
   It is defined in the default configuration.

2. Use LTE Link Monitor to connect to the development kit.
   See :ref:`lte_connect` for instructions.
   You can then use this connection to send or receive AT commands over UART, and to see the log output of the development kit.

   Alternatively, you can use a terminal emulator like `Termite`_, `Teraterm`_, or PuTTY to establish a terminal connection to the development kit, using the following settings:

   * Baud rate: 115200
   * 8 data bits
   * 1 stop bit
   * No parity
   * HW flow control: None

   .. note::

      The default AT command terminator is a carriage return followed by a line feed (``\r\n``).
      LTE Link Monitor supports this format.
      If you want to use another terminal emulator, make sure that the configured AT command terminator corresponds to the line terminator of your terminal.

      When using `Termite`_ and `Teraterm`_, configure the AT command terminator as follows:

      .. figure:: images/termite.svg
         :alt: Termite configuration for sending AT commands through UART

      .. figure:: images/teraterm.svg
         :alt: Teraterm configuration for sending AT commands through UART

      When using PuTTY, you must set the :ref:`CONFIG_SLM_CR_TERMINATION <CONFIG_SLM_CR_TERMINATION>` SLM configuration option instead.
      See :ref:`application configuration <slm_config>` for more details.

.. slm_connecting_9160dk_pc_instr_end

.. _slm_connecting_9160dk_mcu:

Connecting with an external MCU
-------------------------------

.. note::

   This section does not apply to Thingy:91 as it does not have UART2.

If you run your user application on an external MCU (for example, an nRF52 Series development kit), you can control the modem on nRF9160 directly from the application.
See the `nRF52 client for Serial LTE Modem application`_ repository for a sample implementation of such an application.

To connect with an external MCU, set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_UART_2_NRF_HW_ASYNC_TIMER` and :ref:`CONFIG_SLM_CONNECT_UART_2 <CONFIG_SLM_CONNECT_UART_2>` configuration options in the Serial LTE Modem application configuration.

The following table shows how to connect an nRF52 Series development kit to the nRF9160 DK to be able to communicate through UART:

.. list-table::
   :align: center
   :header-rows: 1

   * - nRF52 Series DK
     - nRF9160 DK
   * - UART TX P0.6
     - UART RX P0.11
   * - UART RX P0.8
     - UART TX P0.10
   * - UART CTS P0.7
     - UART RTS P0.12
   * - UART RTS P0.5
     - UART CTS P0.13
   * - GPIO OUT P0.27
     - GPIO IN P0.31
   * - GPIO IN P0.26
     - GPIO OUT P0.30

Use the following UART instances:

* nRF52840 or nRF52832 - UART0
* nRF9160 - UART2

Use the following UART configuration:

* Hardware flow control: enabled
* Baud rate: 115200
* Parity bit: no
* Operation mode: IRQ

.. note::
   The GPIO output level on the nRF9160 side must be 3 V.
   You can set the VDD voltage with the **VDD IO** switch (**SW9**).
   See the `VDD supply rail section in the nRF9160 DK User Guide`_ for more information.

.. _slm_connecting_thingy91:

Communicating with the modem on Thingy:91
=========================================

In this scenario, Thingy:91 running the Serial LTE Modem application serves as the host.
You can use only a PC as a client.

.. _slm_connecting_thingy91_pc:

Connecting with a PC
--------------------

To connect to Thingy:91 with a PC, you must first program the :ref:`connectivity_bridge` on the nrf52840 of Thingy:91.
It routes ``UART_0`` to ``USB_CDC0`` on Thingy:91.
By enabling the option ``CONFIG_BRIDGE_BLE_ENABLE`` , you can also use SLM over :ref:`nus_service_readme`.

Then follow the instructions below:

.. include:: slm_description.rst
   :start-after: .. slm_connecting_9160dk_pc_instr_start
   :end-before: .. slm_connecting_9160dk_pc_instr_end

You can also test the i2c sensor on Thingy:91 using :ref:`SLM_AT_TWI`.
See :ref:`slm_testing_twi` for more details.

.. _slm_testing_section:

Testing
=======

The following testing instructions focus on testing the application with a PC client.
If you have an nRF52 Series DK running a client application, you can also use this DK for testing the different scenarios.

|test_sample|

1. |connect_kit|
#. :ref:`Connect to the kit with LTE Link Monitor <lte_connect>`.
   If you want to use a different terminal emulator, see `slm_connecting_9160dk_pc`_.
#. Reset the kit.
#. Observe that the development kit sends a ``Ready\r\n`` message on UART.
#. Enter ``AT+CFUN=1`` to turn on the modem and connect to the network.
#. Enter ``AT+CFUN?`` and observe that the connection indicators in the LTE Link Monitor side panel turn green.
   This indicates that the modem is connected to the network.
#. Send AT commands and observe the responses from the development kit.

   See :ref:`slm_testing` for typical test cases.
