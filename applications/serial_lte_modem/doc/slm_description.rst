Overview
********

The nRF9160 SiP integrates both a full LTE modem and an application MCU, which enables you to run your LTE application directly on the nRF9160.

However, you might want to run your application on a different chip and use the nRF9160 only as a modem.
For this use case, the serial LTE modem application provides an interface for controlling the LTE modem through AT commands.

The proprietary AT commands that are specific to the serial LTE modem application are described in the :ref:`SLM_AT_intro` documentation.
In addition to these proprietary AT commands, the application supports the nRF91 AT commands described in the `AT Commands Reference Guide`_.

Communicating with the modem
============================

The nRF9160 DK running the serial LTE modem application serves as the host.
As a client, you can use either a PC or an external MCU.

Connecting with a PC
--------------------

To connect to the nRF9160 DK with a PC, make sure that :option:`CONFIG_SLM_CONNECT_UART_0` is defined in the application.
It is defined in the default configuration.

Use LTE Link Monitor to connect to the nRF9160 DK.
See :ref:`lte_connect` for instructions.
You can then use this connection to send or receive AT commands over UART, and to see the log output of the nRF9160 DK.

Alternatively, you can use a terminal emulator like PuTTY to establish a terminal connection to the nRF9160 DK.
See :ref:`putty` for instructions.

.. note::
   The default AT command terminator is carriage return and line feed (``\r\n``).
   LTE Link Monitor supports this format.
   When connecting with another terminal emulator, make sure that the configured AT command terminator corresponds to the line terminator of your terminal.
   You can change the termination mode in the :ref:`application configuration <slm_config>`.

Connecting with an external MCU
-------------------------------

If you run your user application on an external MCU (for example, an nRF52 Series DK), you can control the modem on the nRF9160 directly from the application.
See the `nRF52 client for serial LTE modem application`_ repository for a sample implementation of such an application.

To connect with an external MCU, you must set the configuration option :option:`CONFIG_UART_2_NRF_HW_ASYNC_TIMER` and :option:`CONFIG_SLM_CONNECT_UART_2` in the serial LTE modem application configuration.

The following table shows how to connect an nRF52 Series DK to the nRF9160 DK to be able to communicate through UART:

.. list-table::

Configuration options
=====================

Check and configure the following configuration options for the sample:

.. option:: CONFIG_SLM_NATIVE_TLS

   This option enables using Zephyr's mbedTLS.
   It requires additional configuration.
   See :ref:`slm_native_tls` for more information.

.. option:: CONFIG_SLM_EXTERNAL_XTAL - Use external XTAL for UARTE

   This option configures the application to use an external XTAL for UARTE.
   See the `nRF9160 Product Specification`_ (section 6.19 UARTE) for more information.

.. option:: CONFIG_SLM_CONNECT_UART_0 - UART 0

   This option selects UART 0 for the UART connection.

.. option:: CONFIG_SLM_MQTTC - MQTT client support in SLM

   This option enables additional AT commands for using the MQTT client service.

.. option:: CONFIG_SLM_HTTPC - HTTP client support in SLM

   This option enables additional AT commands for using the HTTP client service.


Additional configuration
========================

Check and configure the following library options that are used by the sample:

* :option:`CONFIG_SUPL_CLIENT_LIB` - Enables the :ref:`supl_client`.

To save power, console and logging output over ``UART_0`` is disabled in this application.
This information is logged to RTT instead.
See :ref:`testing_rtt_connect` for instructions on how to view this information.

To switch to UART output, change the following options in the :file:`prj.conf` file::

   # Segger RTT
   CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT=n
   CONFIG_RTT_CONSOLE=n
   CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE=y
   CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_RTT=n
   CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_UART=y


Configuration files
===================

The sample provides predefined configuration files for both the parent image and the child image.
You can find the configuration files in the :file:`applications/nrf9160/serial_lte_modem` directory.

The following files are provided:

* :file:`prj.conf` - This configuration file contains the standard configuration for the serial LTE modem application.

* :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` - This configuration file contains additional configuration options that are required to use :ref:`slm_native_tls`.
  You can include it by adding ``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-native_tls.conf`` to your build command.
  See :ref:`cmake_options`.

* :file:`child_secure_partition_manager.conf` - This configuration file contains the project-specific configuration for the :ref:`secure_partition_manager` child image.

.. _slm_native_tls:

Native TLS sockets
------------------

By default, the secure socket (TLS/DTLS) is offloaded onto the modem.
However, if you require customized TLS/DTLS features that are not supported by the modem firmware, you can use a native TLS socket instead.
The serial LTE modem application will then handle all secure sockets used in TCP/IP, TCP/IP proxy, and MQTT.

If native TLS is enabled, the `Credential storage management %CMNG`_ command is overridden to map the :ref:`security tag <nrfxlib:security_tags>` from the serial LTE modem application to the modem.
You must use the overridden AT%CMNG command to provision credentials to the modem.
Note that the serial LTE modem application supports security tags in the range of 0 - 214748364.

The configuration options that are required to enable the native TLS socket are defined in the :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` file.

.. note::

   The following limitations exist for native TLS sockets:

   * PSK, PSK identity, and Public Key are currently not supported.
   * DTLS server is currently not supported.
   * ``AT%CMNG=1`` is not supported.
   * FTP client and HTTP client do currently not support native TLS.
