Serial LTE modem
################

The Serial LTE Modem (SLM) application can be used to emulate a stand-alone LTE modem on an nRF91 Series device.
The application accepts both the modem-specific AT commands documented in the `nRF91 AT Commands Reference Guide <AT Commands Reference Guide_>`_ and proprietary AT commands documented in :ref:`SLM_AT_intro`.

See the subpages for how to use the application, how to extend it, and information on the supported AT commands.
