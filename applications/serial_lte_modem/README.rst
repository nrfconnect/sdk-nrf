Serial LTE modem
################

The Serial LTE Modem (SLM) application can be used to emulate a stand-alone LTE modem on an nRF91 Series device.
The application accepts both the modem-specific AT commands and proprietary AT commands.
The AT commands are documented in the following guides:

* Modem-specific AT commands - `nRF91x1 AT Commands Reference Guide`_  and `nRF9160 AT Commands Reference Guide`_
* Proprietary AT commands - :ref:`SLM_AT_intro`

See the subpages for how to use the application, how to extend it, and information on the supported AT commands.
