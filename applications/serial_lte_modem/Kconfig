	default -1
	help
	  Interface GPIO pin used to put the SiP into deep sleep and wake up from it or exit idle.
	  The pin is configured with a pull up and must be pulled down shortly to perform one power off or wake up operation.

config SLM_INDICATE_PIN
	int "Indicate pin"
	default -1
	help
	  Interface GPIO pin used to indicate that data is available when SLM is idle (after #XSLEEP=2 AT command).

	bool "AT channel automatic fallback to DLCI 1 when PPP stops."
	help
	  This is mainly intended for compatibility with Zephyr's cellular modem driver.
	  If enabled, when PPP stops (which happens automatically when the LTE link goes down)
	  CMUX will make the AT channel be on DLCI 1. This only has an effect if it had been
	  configured to be elsewhere, e.g. with AT#XCMUX=2.
