   :depth: 2

The nRF Machine Learning application gathers data from sensors, forwards data to the Edge Impulse platform, and runs the machine learning model.
It also displays the results of the machine learning model on LEDs.
The Edge Impulse platform collects data from sensors, trains the machine learning model, and deploys the model to your Nordic Semiconductor's device.
To learn more about Edge Impulse support in the |NCS| see :ref:`ug_edge_impulse`.

Application overview
********************

To perform its tasks, the nRF Machine Learning application uses components available in Zephyr and the |NCS|, namely the :ref:`lib_caf` modules and :ref:`zephyr:sensor` for sampling sensors, and :ref:`zephyr:uart_api` or :ref:`nus_service_readme` for forwarding data.
It also uses the `Edge Impulse's data forwarder`_ protocol.

Sampling sensors
================

The application handles the sensor sampling using the :ref:`caf_sensor_manager`.
This module uses Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:sensor` to handle the sampling.
This approach allows you to use any sensor available in Zephyr.

By default, the following sensors are used by the application:

* Thingy:53 - Built-in accelerometer (``ADXL362``).
* nRF52840 :term:`Development Kit (DK)` - Simulated sensor (:ref:`sensor_sim`).
  The simulated sensor generates predefined waves as acceleration.
  This development kit does not have a built-in accelerometer.
* nRF5340 DK - Simulated sensor (:ref:`sensor_sim`).
  The simulated sensor generates predefined waves as acceleration.
  This development kit does not have a built-in accelerometer.
* nRF54H20 DK - The development kit does not have a built-in accelerometer.
  However, it supports the following configurations:

   * Single-core - Accelerometer (``ADXL362``) connected to the DK with the PCA63566 shield.
     See the shield documentation under the :file:`nrf/boards/shields/pca63566/doc/index.rst` path.
   * Dual-core - Accelerometer (``ADXL362``) connected to the DK with the PCA63566 shield.
     Sensor is sampled from :term:`Peripheral Processor (PPR) <Peripheral Processor (PPR, pronounced “Pepper”)>`.
     See the shield documentation under the :file:`nrf/boards/shields/pca63566/doc/index.rst` path.

Forwarding data
===============

The application uses `Edge Impulse's data forwarder`_ protocol to forward data to `Edge Impulse studio`_.
By default, the following transports are used:

* Thingy:53 uses :ref:`nus_service_readme`.
* The nRF52840 DK uses :ref:`zephyr:uart_api`.
* The nRF5340 DK uses :ref:`zephyr:uart_api`.
* The nRF54H20 DK uses :ref:`nus_service_readme`.

Machine learning model
======================

The application handles the machine learning model using the :ref:`ei_wrapper` library available in the |NCS|.
The model performs the classification task by assigning a label to the input data.
The labels that are assigned by the machine learning model are specific to the given model.

By default, the application uses pre-trained machine learning models deployed in `Edge Impulse studio`_:

* Thingy:53 uses the `nRF Connect SDK hardware accelerometer machine learning model`_.
  The model uses the data from the built-in accelerometer to recognize the following gestures:

  * ``idle`` - The device is placed on a flat surface.
  * ``updown`` - The device is moved in up-down direction.
  * ``rotate`` - The device is rotated.
  * ``tap`` - The device is tapped while placed on a flat surface.

  Unknown gestures, such as shaking the device, are recognized as anomalies.
* Both the nRF52840 DK and the nRF5340 DK use the `nRF Connect SDK simulated sensor machine learning model`_.
  The model uses simulated sensor data to recognize the following simulated wave types:

  * ``sine``
  * ``triangle``
  * ``idle``

  The ``square`` wave signal can also be generated by the simulated sensor.
  This signal is unknown to the machine learning model, and therefore, it is marked as an anomaly.

The application displays LED effects that correspond to the machine learning results.
For more detailed information, see the `User interface`_ section.

Power management
================

Reducing power consumption is important for all battery-powered devices.

In the nRF Machine Learning application, application modules are automatically suspended or turned off if the device is not in use for a predefined period.
The application uses :ref:`caf_power_manager` for this purpose.
This means that Zephyr power management is forced to the :c:enumerator:`PM_STATE_ACTIVE` state when the device is in either the power management active or the power management suspended state, but the power off state is forced directly by :ref:`caf_power_manager` as Zephyr's :c:enumerator:`PM_STATE_SOFT_OFF` state.

* In the :c:enumerator:`POWER_MANAGER_LEVEL_ALIVE` state, the device is in working condition, Bluetooth® is advertising whenever required and all the connections are maintained.
* In the :c:enumerator:`POWER_MANAGER_LEVEL_SUSPENDED` state, the device maintains the active Bluetooth connection.
* In the :c:enumerator:`POWER_MANAGER_LEVEL_OFF` state, the CPU is switched to the off mode.

In the suspended and OFF states, most of the functionalities are disabled.
For example, LEDs and sensors are turned off, and Bluetooth advertising is stopped.

Any button press can wake up the device.

For the Thingy:53, the sensor supports a trigger that can be used for active power management.
As long as the device detects acceleration, the board is kept in the active state.
When the board is in the :c:enumerator:`POWER_MANAGER_LEVEL_SUSPENDED` state, it can be woken up by acceleration threshold by moving the device.

You can define the time interval after which the peripherals are suspended or powered off using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_POWER_MANAGER_TIMEOUT` Kconfig option.
By default, this period is set to 120 seconds.

.. _nrf_machine_learning_app_architecture:

Firmware architecture
=====================

The nRF Machine Learning application has a modular structure, where each module has a defined scope of responsibility.
The application uses the :ref:`app_event_manager` to distribute events between modules in the system.

The following figure shows the application architecture.
The figure visualizes relations between Application Event Manager, modules, drivers, and libraries.

.. figure:: /images/ml_app_architecture.svg
   :alt: nRF Machine Learning application architecture

   nRF Machine Learning application architecture

Since the application architecture is uniform and the code is shared, the set of modules in use depends on configuration.
In other words, all modules do not need to be enabled for a given reference design.
For example, the :ref:`caf_ble_state` and :ref:`caf_ble_adv` modules are not enabled if the configuration does not use Bluetooth.

See :ref:`nrf_machine_learning_app_internal_modules` for detailed information about every module used by the nRF Machine Learning application.

Firmware architecture for nRF54H20 DK
-------------------------------------

On the nRF54H20 DK, the architecture of the nRF Machine Learning application is split in two, as part of the application is running on a separate :term:`Peripheral Processor (PPR) <Peripheral Processor (PPR, pronounced “Pepper”)>`.
PPR handles sensor sampling and sending of data to the application processor.

The following figure shows the application architecture for the nRF54H20 DK, visualizing the relations between the Application Event Manager, modules, drivers, and libraries.

Programming Thingy:53
=====================

|thingy53_sample_note|

Programming nRF5340 DK
======================

If you build this application for the nRF5340 DK, it enables additional features similar to the ones that are enabled for Thingy:53:

* MCUboot bootloader with serial recovery and multi-image update.
* Static configuration of :ref:`partition_manager`.
* DFU over-the-air using :term:`Simple Management Protocol (SMP)` over Bluetooth.

See :ref:`ug_thingy53` for detailed information about these features.

The nRF5340 DK has a J-Link debug IC that you can use to program the firmware.
Alternatively, you can update the firmware over MCUboot serial recovery or DFU over-the-air using the Simple Management Protocol over Bluetooth.
If you use the bootloader to update the firmware, the new firmware must be compatible with the used bootloader and partition map.

The nRF5340 DK uses RTT as the logger's backend.
The RTT logs can be easily accessed, because the DK has a built-in SEGGER chip.

Custom model requirements
=========================

The default application configurations rely on pre-trained machine learning models that can be automatically downloaded during the application build.
If you want to train and deploy a custom machine learning model using `Edge Impulse Studio`_, you need a user account for the Edge Impulse Studio web-based tool.
You do not need a user account to perform predictions using the pre-trained models.

Data forwarding requirements
============================

To forward the collected data using `Edge Impulse's data forwarder`_, you must install the Edge Impulse CLI.
See the `Edge Impulse CLI installation guide`_ for instructions.

Nordic UART Service requirements
--------------------------------

If you want to forward data over :ref:`nus_service_readme`, you need an additional development kit that is able to run the :ref:`central_uart` sample.
Check the Requirements section of the sample for the list of supported development kits.
The sample is used to receive data over NUS and forward it to the host computer over UART.
See `Testing with Thingy:53`_ for how to test this solution.

Requirements
************

The application supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

The available configurations use only built-in sensors or the simulated sensor signal.
You do not need to connect any additional components to the board.

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

User interface
**************

The application supports a simple user interface.
You can control the application using predefined buttons, while LEDs are used to display information.

Buttons
=======

The application supports a button that is used to switch between data forwarding and running the machine learning model.
To trigger the change, press and hold the button for longer than five seconds.

.. note::
   If a given configuration supports Bluetooth, two sequences of the button press and release in a short time interval, right after application boot, removes the Bluetooth bonds.

If the application uses the simulated sensor signal, you can use another button to change the signal generated by the simulated sensor.
The change is triggered by any press of the button.

By default, the following buttons are used by the application:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Thingy:53

      The **SW3** button switches between data forwarding and running the machine learning model.

   .. group-tab:: nRF52840 and nRF5340 DKs

      * **Button 1** switches between data forwarding and running a machine learning model.
      * **Button 3** changes the signal generated by the simulated sensor.

   .. group-tab:: nRF54H20 DK

      **Button 0** button switches between data forwarding and running the machine learning model.

LEDs
====

The application uses one LED to display the application state.
The LED displays either the state of data forwarding or the machine learning prediction results.
You can configure the LED effect in the application configuration files.

If the application uses the simulated sensor signal, it uses another LED to display the effect that represents the signal generated by the simulated sensor.
The application defines common LED effects for both the machine learning results and the simulated sensor signal.

By default, the application uses the following LED effects:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Thingy:53

      Thingy:53 displays the application state in the RGB scale using **LED1**.

      * If the device is returning the machine learning prediction results, the LED uses the following predefined colors:

         * ``rotate`` - Red
         * ``updown`` - Green
         * ``tap`` - Blue
         * Anomaly - Purple

         If the machine learning model is running but has not detected anything yet or the ``idle`` state is detected, the LED is blinking.
         After a successful detection, the LED is set to the predefined color.
         The LED effect is overridden on the next successful detection.
      * If the device forwards data, the LED color turns red and uses the following blinking patterns:

         * LED blinks slowly if it is not connected.
         * LED blinks with an average frequency if it is connected but is not actively forwarding data.
         * LED blinks rapidly if it is connected and is actively forwarding data.

   .. group-tab:: nRF52840 and nRF5340 DKs

      Both nRF5340 DK and nRF52840 DK use monochromatic LEDs to display the application state.
      The **LED1** displays the application state, and the **LED2** displays the signal generated by the simulated sensor.

      * If the device is returning the machine learning prediction results, the **LED1** blinks for a predefined number of times and then turns off for a period of time.
        Then the sequence is repeated.
        The machine learning result is represented by the number of blinks:

         * ``sine`` - 1 blink
         * ``triangle`` - 2 blinks
         * ``square`` - 3 blinks
         * ``idle`` - 4 blinks

         If the machine learning model is running but has not detected anything yet or has detected an anomaly, the **LED1** is breathing.
      * If the device forwards data, the **LED1** has the following blinking patterns:

         * LED blinks slowly if it is not connected.
         * LED blinks with an average frequency if it is connected but is not actively forwarding data.
         * LED blinks rapidly if it is connected and is actively forwarding data.

   .. group-tab:: nRF54H20 DK
      nRF54H20 DK uses monochromatic LEDs to display the application state.
      **LED0**, **LED1** and **LED2** display the application state.

      * If the device is returning the machine learning prediction results, a pattern of LEDs are turn on.
        The machine learning result is represented by:

         * **LED0** - ``updown``
         * **LED1** - ``rotate``
         * **LED2** - ``tap``
         * **LED2** and **LED3** - Anomaly

         If the machine learning model is running, but it has not detected anything yet or the ``idle`` state is detected, **LED0**, **LED1**, and **LED2**, keep blinking.
      * If the device forwards data, **LED0**, **LED1** and **LED2** has the following blinking patterns:

         * LED blinks slowly if it is not connected.
         * LED blinks with an average frequency if it is connected, but is not actively forwarding data.
         * LED blinks rapidly if it is connected and is actively forwarding data.

.. _nrf_machine_learning_app_configuration:

Configuration
*************

|config|

Configuration files
===================

The nRF Machine Learning application uses the following files as configuration sources:

* Devicetree Specification (DTS) files - These reflect the hardware configuration.
  See :ref:`zephyr:dt-guide` for more information about the DTS data structure.
* Kconfig files - These reflect the software configuration.
  See :ref:`kconfig_tips_and_tricks` for information about how to configure them.
* :file:`_def` files - These contain configuration arrays for the application modules.
  The :file:`_def` files are used by the nRF Machine Learning application modules and :ref:`lib_caf` modules.

The application configuration files for a given board must be defined in a board-specific directory in the :file:`applications/machine_learning/configuration/` directory.
For example, the configuration files for the Thingy:53 are defined in the :file:`applications/machine_learning/configuration/thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp` directory.

The following configuration files can be defined for any supported board:

* :file:`prj_<build_type>.conf` - Kconfig configuration file for a :ref:`custom build type <modifying_build_types>`.
  To support a given build type for the selected board, you must define the configuration file with a proper name.
  See :ref:`nrf_machine_learning_app_configuration_build_types` for more information.
* :file:`app.overlay` - DTS overlay file specific for the board.
  Defining the DTS overlay file for a given board is optional.
* :file:`_def` files - These files are defined separately for modules used by the application.
  You must define a :file:`_def` file for every module that requires it and enable it in the configuration for the given board.
  The :file:`_def` files that are common for all the boards and build types are located in the :file:`applications/machine_learning/configuration/common` directory.

The nRF Machine Learning application introduces application-specific Kconfig options that you can use to simplify the application configuration.
For more information, see the :ref:`nrf_machine_learning_configuration` page.

Multi-image builds
------------------

The Thingy:53 and the nRF5340 DK use multi-image build with the following child images:

* MCUboot bootloader
* Bluetooth HCI RPMsg

You can define the application-specific configuration for the mentioned child images in the board-specific directory in the :file:`applications/machine_learning/configuration/` directory.
The Kconfig configuration file should be located in subdirectory :file:`child_image/<child_image_name>` and its name should match the application Kconfig file name, and it should contain the build type if necessary.
For example, the :file:`applications/machine_learning/configuration/thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp/child_image/hci_ipc/prj.conf` file defines configuration of Bluetooth HCI RPMsg for the ``debug`` build type on ``thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp`` board, while the :file:`applications/machine_learning/configuration/thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp/child_image/hci_ipc/prj_release.conf` file defines configuration of Bluetooth HCI RPMsg for the ``release`` build type.
See :ref:`ug_multi_image` for detailed information about multi-image builds and child image configuration.

Building and running
********************

The nRF Machine Learning application is built the same way as any other |NCS| application or sample.
Building the default configurations requires an Internet connection, because the machine learning model source files are downloaded from the web during the application build.

.. |application path| replace:: :file:`applications/machine_learning`

.. include:: /includes/application_build_and_run.txt

nRF54H20 DK

   .. note::
      This application does not work in the default configuration for the nRF54H20 DK without additional parameters like shields or snippets.

  To build the application for the nRF54H20 DK with the sensor sampling done by the Application core (single-core application), run the following command:

  .. code-block:: console

     west build -b nrf54h20dk/nrf54h20/cpuapp -- -Dmachine_learning_SHIELD=pca63566 -DFILE_SUFFIX="singlecore"

  or use twister test case:

    .. code-block:: console

      west build -b nrf54h20dk/nrf54h20/cpuapp -T applications.machine_learning.sensor_hub.zdebug.singlecore .

  To build the application for the nRF54H20 DK with the sensor sampling on the PPR core (dual-core application), run the following command:

  .. code-block:: console

     west build -b nrf54h20dk/nrf54h20/cpuapp -- -DSB_CONFIG_ML_APP_INCLUDE_REMOTE_IMAGE=y -Dmachine_learning_SNIPPET=nordic-ppr -Dmachine_learning_SHIELD=pca63566_fwd -Dremote_SHIELD=pca63566

  or use twister test case:

  .. code-block:: console

     west build -b nrf54h20dk/nrf54h20/cpuapp -T applications.machine_learning.sensor_hub.zdebug .

  .. include:: /includes/nRF54H20_erase_UICR.txt

Selecting a build type
======================

Before you start testing the application, you can select one of the :ref:`nrf_machine_learning_app_requirements_build_types`.
See :ref:`cmake_options` for information about how to select a build type.

Providing API key
=================

If the URI of the Edge Impulse :file:`.zip` file requires providing an additional API key, you can provide it using the :c:macro:`EI_API_KEY_HEADER` CMake definition.
This definition is set in a similar way as selecting a build type.
For more detailed information about building the machine learning model in the |NCS|, see :ref:`ug_edge_impulse`.

.. tip::
   The nRF Machine Learning application configurations available in the |NCS| do not require providing an API key to download the model.
   The model is downloaded from the web, but no authentication is required.

Testing
=======

After programming the application to your development kit, you can test the nRF Machine Learning application.
You can test running the machine learning model on an embedded device and forwarding data to `Edge Impulse studio`_.
The detailed test steps for the DKs and the Thingy:53 are described in the following subsections.

Application logs
----------------

In most of the provided ``debug`` configurations, the application provides logs through the RTT.
See :ref:`testing_rtt_connect` for detailed instructions about accessing the logs.

.. note::
   The Thingy:53 in the ``debug`` configuration provides logs through the USB CDC ACM serial.
   See :ref:`ug_thingy53` for detailed information about working with the Thingy:53.

   You can also use the ``rtt`` configuration to have the Thingy:53 use RTT for logs.

Testing with Thingy:53
----------------------

After programming the application, perform the following steps to test the nRF Machine Learning application on the Thingy:

1. Turn on the Thingy.
   The application starts in a mode that runs the machine learning model.
   The RGB LED is blinking, because no gesture has been recognized by the machine learning model yet.
#. Tap the device.
   The ``tap`` gesture is recognized by the machine learning model.
   The LED color changes to blue, and the LED stays turned on.
#. Move the device up and down.
   The ``updown`` gesture is recognized by the machine learning model.
   The LED color changes to green, and the LED stays turned on.
#. Rotate the device.
   The ``rotate`` gesture is recognized by the machine learning model.
   The LED color changes to red, and the LED stays turned on.
#. Shake the device.
   The machine learning model detects an anomaly.
   The LED color changes to purple and the LED stays turned on.
#. Press and hold the button for more than five seconds to switch to the data forwarding mode.
   After the mode is switched, the LED color changes to red, and the LED starts blinking very slowly.
#. Program the :ref:`central_uart` sample to a compatible development kit, for example, the nRF52840 DK.
#. Turn on the programmed device.
   After a brief delay, the Bluetooth connection between the sample and the Thingy is established.
   The Thingy forwards the sensor readouts over NUS.
   The LED on the Thingy starts to blink rapidly.
#. Connect to the sample with a terminal emulator (for example, `nRF Connect Serial Terminal`_).
   See :ref:`test_and_optimize` for the required settings.
#. Observe the sensor readouts represented as comma-separated values.
   Every line represents a single sensor readout.
   The Thingy forwards sensor readouts over NUS to the sample.
   The sample forwards the data to the host over UART.
#. Turn off the terminal emulator to ensure that only one program has access to data on UART.

Optionally, you can also connect to the device using `Edge Impulse's data forwarder`_ and forward data to `Edge Impulse studio`_ (after logging in).
See `Forwarding data to Edge Impulse studio`_ for details.

Testing with the nRF52840 or nRF5340 DK
---------------------------------------

After programming the application, perform the following steps to test the nRF Machine Learning application on the DK:

1. Turn on the development kit.
   The application starts in a mode that runs the machine learning model.
   Initially, **LED2** displays the LED effect representing ``sine`` wave (1 blink), and **LED1** is breathing, because the signal was not yet recognized by the machine learning model.
   After a brief delay, the machine learning model recognizes the simulated signal.
   **LED1** and **LED2** display the same LED effect.
#. Press **Button 3** to change the generated acceleration signal.
   Right after the signal change, the effects displayed by LEDs are different.
   After a brief delay, the machine learning model recognizes the ``triangle`` wave, and the same effect (2 blinks) is displayed by both LEDs.
#. Press **Button 3** to again change the generated acceleration signal.
   The ``square`` wave (3 blinks) is displayed only by the **LED2**.
   This signal is marked as an anomaly by the machine learning model, and **LED1** starts breathing.
#. Press and hold **Button 1** for more than five seconds to switch to the data forwarding mode.
   After the mode is switched, **LED1** starts to blink rapidly.
#. Connect to the development kit with a terminal emulator (for example, `nRF Connect Serial Terminal`_).
   See :ref:`test_and_optimize` for the required settings.
#. Observe the sensor readouts represented as comma-separated values.
   Every line represents a single sensor readout.
#. Turn off the terminal emulator to ensure that only one program has access to the data on UART.

Optionally, you can also connect to the device using `Edge Impulse's data forwarder`_ and forward data to `Edge Impulse studio`_ (after logging in).
See `Forwarding data to Edge Impulse studio`_ for details.

Testing with the nRF54H20 DK
-----------------------------

After programming the application, perform the following steps to test the nRF Machine Learning application on the DK:

1. Turn on your DK.
   The application starts in a mode that runs the machine learning model.
   **LED0**, **LED1**, and **LED2** are blinking because no gesture has been recognized by the machine learning model yet.
#. Move the device up and down.
   The ``updown`` gesture is recognized by the machine learning model.
   **LED0** turns on for some time.
#. Rotate the device.
   The ``rotate`` gesture is recognized by the machine learning model.
   **LED1** turns on for some time.
#. Tap the device.
   The ``tap`` gesture is recognized by the machine learning model.
   **LED2** turns on for some time.
#. Shake the device.
   The machine learning model detects an anomaly.
   **LED1** and **LED2** turn on for some time.

Gesture detection results can also be read using the Nordic Status Message Service.

1. Start the `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ application on your smartphone or tablet.
#. Connect to the device from the application.
   The device is advertising as ``Sensor HUB``.
   The services of the connected device are shown.
   If the device cannot be found - the DK might be connected to the other device.
   Terminate the connection with the other device, refresh the scanning, and connect to the DK.
   If the device disconnects shortly after being connected, the DK might have saved bonding data from previous connection.
   You can erase the bonding data by double-clicking the **Button 0** within three seconds after the application reboots.
#. Find **Nordic Status Message Service** by its name or UUID (``57a70001-9350-11ed-a1eb-0242ac120002``).
#. Read its **Characteristic User Description** to see that it is ``Gesture``.
#. Read the **Nordic Status Message Service** message characteristic to check the initial status.
   It presents the status string that describes the previously detected gesture.
#. Enable notification for the characteristic.
#. Move the device up and down.
   The ``updown`` gesture is recognized by the machine learning model and **Nordic Status Message Service** is updated.
   **LED0** turns on for some time.
#. Rotate the device.
   The ``rotate`` gesture is recognized by the machine learning model and **Nordic Status Message Service** is updated.
   **LED1** turns on for some time.
#. Tap the device.
   The ``tap`` gesture is recognized by the machine learning model and **Nordic Status Message Service** is updated.
   **LED2** turns on for some time.
#. Disconnect the `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ application from the device.

Forwarding data.

1. Press and hold **Button 0** for more than five seconds to switch to the data forwarding mode.
   After the mode is switched, **LED0**, **LED1**, and **LED2** start blinking very slowly.
#. Test the data forwarding mode of the application with the `nRF Connect for Mobile`_:

   a. Open the `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ application and connect to the device again.
   #. Bond with the device from the `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ application on your smartphone or tablet.
   #. Find **Nordic UART Service** and enable notification of its "TX Charcteristic".
   #. Observe the sensor readouts represented as comma-separated values.
      Every new value represents a single sensor readout.

#. Test the data forwarding mode with an additional DK:

   a. Program the :ref:`central_uart` sample to a compatible development kit, for example the nRF52840.
   #. Turn on the programmed device.
      After a brief delay, the Bluetooth® connection between the sample and the DK is established.
      The nRF54H20 DK forwards the sensor readouts over NUS to the Central UART sample.
      The **LED0**, **LED1**, and **LED2** on the nRF54H20 DK start blinking rapidly.
   #. Connect to the Bluetooth Central UART sample with a terminal emulator (for example, PuTTY).
      See :ref:`putty` for the required settings.
   #. Observe the sensor readouts represented as comma-separated values.
      Every line represents a single sensor readout.
      The Central UART sample forwards the data to the host over UART.
   #. Turn off PuTTY to ensure that only one program has access to data on UART.

Forwarding data to Edge Impulse studio
--------------------------------------

To start forwarding data to Edge Impulse studio:

1. Make sure you meet the `Data forwarding requirements`_ before forwarding data to Edge Impulse studio.
#. Run the ``edge-impulse-data-forwarder`` Edge Impulse command-line tool.
#. Log in to `Edge Impulse studio`_ and perform the following steps:

   a. Select the :guilabel:`Data acquisition` tab.
   #. In the **Record new data** panel, set the desired values and click :guilabel:`Start sampling`.

Porting guide
*************

You can port the nRF Machine Learning application to any board available in the |NCS| or Zephyr.
Create the board-specific directory in :file:`applications/machine_learning/configuration/` and add the application configuration files there.
See the :ref:`nrf_machine_learning_app_configuration` for detailed information about the nRF Machine Learning application configuration.

Dependencies
************

The application uses the following Zephyr drivers and libraries:

* :ref:`zephyr:sensor`
* :ref:`zephyr:uart_api`
* :ref:`zephyr:mcu_mgr`

The application uses the following |NCS| libraries and drivers:

* :ref:`app_event_manager`
* :ref:`lib_caf`
* :ref:`ei_wrapper`
* :ref:`nus_service_readme`

The sample also uses the following secure firmware component:

* :ref:`Trusted Firmware-M <ug_tfm>`

In addition, you can use the :ref:`central_uart` sample together with the application.
The sample is used to receive data over NUS and forward it to the host over UART.
