Thingy:53: Zigbee weather station
#################################

.. contents::

   :depth: 2

The Zigbee weather station is an out of the box application for the Nordic Thingy:53 based on the Zigbee protocol.
It allows you to build a weather station that remotely gathers different kinds of data using Thingy:53 sensors, such as temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity.
The device works as a Zigbee device, meaning it can be paired and controlled remotely over a Zigbee network.
You can use this application as a reference for creating your own application.

Requirements
************

The application supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

To commission the Zigbee weather station device and control it remotely through a Zigbee network, you also need to program a Zigbee network coordinator on a separate compatible development kit.
The Zigbee network coordinator forms the network that the weather station node will join and share its measurement data with.
You can use one of the following options to set up the Zigbee network coordinator:

* For `Testing`_ purposes, program the :ref:`Zigbee shell <zigbee_shell_sample>` as the network coordinator to be able to use the interactive shell for readings and bindings.
  Read the sample documentation for more information.
* For generic usage of the application, you can use the standard :ref:`Zigbee network coordinator <zigbee_network_coordinator_sample>`.

To program a Thingy:53 device from which the preprogrammed MCUboot bootloader has been erased, you need an external J-Link programmer.
If you have an nRF5340 DK that has an onboard J-Link programmer, you can also use it for this purpose.

If the Thingy:53 device is programmed with a Thingy:53-compatible sample or application, you can also update the firmware using MCUboot's serial recovery or DFU over Bluetooth LE.
See :ref:`thingy53_app_guide` for details.

For capturing packets while testing, you can use `nRF Sniffer for 802.15.4`_ with `Wireshark configured for Zigbee <Configuring Wireshark for Zigbee_>`_.

Overview
********

The Zigbee weather station application :ref:`acts as a Zigbee Sleepy End Device <zigbee_ug_sed>`.
During startup, it initializes Thingy:53's built-in sensor and starts periodic data readouts of temperature, pressure, and relative humidity.
Each readout is followed by an update of Zigbee Cluster Library (ZCL) attributes associated with measurements.
Attributes can be accessed over the Zigbee network according to the ZCL specification, that is a given attribute can be read out at any given time on demand or a binding can be created for periodic notifications.

.. _zigbee_weather_station_app_build_types:

Zigbee weather station build types
==================================

The Zigbee weather station application does not use a single :file:`prj.conf` file.
Configuration files are provided for different build types and they are located in the :file:`configuration/thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp` directory.

The :file:`prj.conf` file represents a ``debug`` build type.
Other build types are covered by dedicated files with the build type added as a suffix to the ``prj`` part, as per the following list.
For example, the ``release`` build type file name is :file:`prj_release.conf`.
If a board has other configuration files, for example associated with partition layout or child image configuration, these follow the same pattern.

.. include:: /getting_started/modifying.rst
   :start-after: build_types_overview_start
   :end-before: build_types_overview_end

Before you start testing the application, you can select one of the build types supported by the Zigbee weather station application, depending on the building method.
This application supports the following build types:

* ``debug`` - Debug version of the application. You can use this version to enable additional features for verifying the application behavior, such as logs.
* ``release`` - Release version of the application. You can use this version to enable only the necessary application functionalities to optimize its performance.

.. note::
    `Selecting a build type`_ is optional.
    The ``debug`` build type is used by default if no build type is explicitly selected.

Logging in the ``debug`` build type
===================================

In the ``debug`` build type, the application also uses serial console over USB for logging.
Besides initialization logs, the following sets of measurement-related data are logged after measurements update:

* Values measured by sensor.
  For example:

  .. code-block:: console

     [00:20:06.458,770] <inf> app: Sensor     T: 26.760000 [*C] P: 96.723000 [kPa] H: 23.178000 [%]

* Values set as corresponding ZCL attributes (transformed according to specification).
  For example:

  .. code-block:: console

     [00:20:06.458,801] <inf> app: Attributes T:      2676      P:       967       H:      2317

OTA and DFU
===========

.. note::
   :ref:`lib_zigbee_fota` is not yet supported for this application.
   See the :ref:`Limitations <lib_zigbee_fota_limitations>` section on the Zigbee FOTA library page.

.. WIP: PLACEHOLDER

   OTA and DFU
   ===========

   The application supports over-the-air (OTA) device firmware upgrade (DFU) using the :ref:`lib_zigbee_fota` library.
   The MCUboot secure bootloader is used to apply the new firmware image.
   For information about how to upgrade the device firmware, see the :ref:`zigbee_weather_station_app_dfu` section.


User interface
**************

LED (LD1):
    Shows the overall state of the device and its connectivity.
    The following states are possible:

    * ``release`` build type

      * Even flashing (red color, 500ms on/500ms off) - The device is in the Identify mode (after network commissioning).

    * ``debug`` build type

      * Constant light (blue) - The device is connected to a Zigbee network.
      * Even flashing (red color, 500ms on/500ms off) - The device is in the Identify mode (after network commissioning).

    .. note::
       Thingy:53 allows you to control RGB components of its single LED independently.
       This means that the listed color components can overlap, creating additional color effects.
       For example, **LED (LD1)** can indicate that the device is connected to a Zigbee network in blue, but if the device goes into the Identify mode at the same time, the flashing to indicate this will be purple, not red.

Power switch (SW1):
    Used for switching Thingy:53 on and off.

Button (SW3):
    Depending on how long the button is pressed:

    * If pressed for less than five seconds, it starts or cancels the Identify mode.
    * If pressed for five seconds, it initiates the factory reset of the device.
      The length of the button press can be edited using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FACTORY_RESET_PRESS_TIME_SECONDS` Kconfig option from :ref:`lib_zigbee_application_utilities`.
      Releasing the button within this time does not trigger the factory reset procedure.

    Additionally, pressing the button shortly or releasing it before five second has elapsed indicates user input, which allows a Sleepy End Device to start the network rejoin procedure if it was previously stopped (for example, after timeout).

USB port:
    Used for getting logs from the device.
    It is enabled only for the debug configuration of the application.
    See the `Selecting a build type`_ section to learn how to select the debug configuration.

Configuration
*************

|config|

.. _zigbee_weather_station_app_configuration_readout:

Readout configuration options
=============================

The following application-specific Kconfig option values can be set to custom values:

.. _CONFIG_FIRST_WEATHER_CHECK_DELAY_SECONDS:

CONFIG_FIRST_WEATHER_CHECK_DELAY_SECONDS - Delay after application initialization
   This configuration option defines the delay from the moment of the application initialization to the first sensor data readout.
   The value is provided in seconds, with the default value set to ``5``.

.. _CONFIG_WEATHER_CHECK_PERIOD_SECONDS:

CONFIG_WEATHER_CHECK_PERIOD_SECONDS - How often sensor data is read
   This configuration option defines the period of cyclic sensor readouts after the first readout.
   The value is provided in seconds, with the default value set to ``60``.

Selecting a build type
======================

Before you start testing the application, you can select one of the :ref:`zigbee_weather_station_app_build_types`, depending on your building method.

Selecting a build type in |VSC|
-------------------------------

.. include:: /getting_started/modifying.rst
   :start-after: build_types_selection_vsc_start
   :end-before: build_types_selection_vsc_end

Selecting a build type from command line
----------------------------------------

.. include:: /getting_started/modifying.rst
   :start-after: build_types_selection_cmd_start
   :end-before: For example, you can replace the

For example, you can replace the *selected_build_type* variable to build the ``release`` firmware for ``thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp`` by running the following command in the project directory:

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   west build -b thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp -d build_thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp -- -DCONF_FILE=prj_release.conf

The ``build_thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp`` parameter specifies the output directory for the build files.

.. note::
   If the selected board does not support the selected build type, the build is interrupted.
   For example, if the ``shell`` build type is not supported by the selected board, the following notification appears:

   .. code-block:: console

      File not found: ./ncs/nrf/applications/zigbee_weather_station/configuration/thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp/prj_shell.conf

Testing
=======

Preliminary testing information
    * The testing procedure assumes you are using the ``debug`` :ref:`build type <zigbee_weather_station_app_build_types>`, as it provides more feedback with **LED (LD1)** and logs through the USB console.
      The steps related to the ``debug`` build type are marked as "Optional ``debug`` build type step".
      These steps are not required when using the ``release`` build type.
    * The provided measurement data values depend on the Thingy:53 device's surrounding conditions.

After programming the application, perform the following steps to test the Zigbee weather station application on the Thingy:53 device:

1. If you want to capture packets with Wireshark, install `nRF Sniffer for 802.15.4`_ and `configure Wireshark for use with Zigbee <Configuring Wireshark for Zigbee>`_.
   This is an optional step.
   However, Wireshark response frame examples are provided below for reference.
#. |connect_generic|
   The connection is needed for gathering logs from the Zigbee weather station application.
   This is an optional ``debug`` build type step.
#. Turn on the :ref:`Zigbee shell <zigbee_shell_sample>` sample programmed as the network coordinator to one of the compatible development kits.
   See the Testing section of the sample to learn how to set it up to work as a coordinator.
   Once turned on, the network coordinator forms the network and opens it for other devices to join for 180 seconds.
#. Turn on the Thingy:53 device.
   The application tries to join the Zigbee network automatically.
#. |connect_terminal_generic|
   When the connection is established, initialization logs start to appear in the console.
   They can look like the following:

   .. code-block:: console

      [00:00:02.027,435] <inf> app: Starting...
      [00:00:02.027,526] <inf> app: Initializing sensor...
      [00:00:02.027,526] <inf> app: Initializing sensor...OK
      [00:00:02.027,862] <inf> app: Starting...OK

   After around 5 seconds after the initialization, periodic sensor readouts and attribute setting logs start to appear in the console.
   They will look similar to the following one:

   .. code-block:: console

      [00:00:07.013,793] <inf> app: Sensor     T: 23.470000 [*C] P: 98.347000 [kPa] H: 33.344000 [%]
      [00:00:07.013,824] <inf> app: Attributes T:      2347      P:       983       H:      3334
      [00:01:07.002,777] <inf> app: Sensor     T: 23.520000 [*C] P: 98.344000 [kPa] H: 33.485000 [%]
      [00:01:07.002,807] <inf> app: Attributes T:      2352      P:       983       H:      3348
      [00:02:06.966,003] <inf> app: Sensor     T: 24.360000 [*C] P: 98.344000 [kPa] H: 32.410000 [%]
      [00:02:06.966,033] <inf> app: Attributes T:      2436      P:       983       H:      3241

   .. note::
      These logs appear regardless of whether the device has joined the network.

#. When the device joins the network, **LED (LD1)** lights up with a constant blue color.
   Additionally, with the ``debug`` build type and console used for logging, output similar to the following appears:

   .. code-block:: console

      [00:00:02.029,174] <inf> zigbee_app_utils: Zigbee stack initialized
      [00:00:02.035,003] <inf> zigbee_app_utils: Device started for the first time
      [00:00:02.035,003] <inf> zigbee_app_utils: Start network steering
      [00:00:02.035,064] <inf> zigbee_app_utils: Started network rejoin procedure.
      [00:00:05.637,512] <inf> zigbee_app_utils: Joined network successfully (Extended PAN ID: f4ce3655fc08bf6b, PAN ID: 0xbf9e)

   .. note::
      As timestamps in this snippet indicate, these logs are likely to appear before the periodic sensor or attribute logs.

#. Read the weather attributes from the development kit programmed with the Zigbee shell sample (the network coordinator):

   a. Run the following command to read the temperature attribute:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ zcl attr read 0x1ca9 42 0x0402 0x0104 0x0000

      In this command:

      * ``0x1ca9`` is the short network address of Thingy:53.
      * ``42`` is the endpoint number for aggregating the clusters.
      * ``0x0402`` is the temperature cluster ID.
      * ``0x0104`` is the Zigbee Home Automation profile ID.
      * ``0x0000`` is the short network address of the coordinator device.

      The output will be similar to the following one:

      .. code-block:: console

         ID: 0 Type: 29 Value: 2394

      Here, the value ``2394`` means 23.94 degrees Celsius.
      In Wireshark, the corresponding response frame for this output looks like as follows:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ zcl attr read 0x1ca9 42 0x0405 0x0104 0x0000

      Compared with the previous command, ``0x0405`` in this command stands for the relative humidity cluster ID.
      The output will be similar to the following one:

      .. code-block:: console

         ID: 0 Type: 21 Value: 3293

      Here, the value ``3293`` means a humidity reading of 32.93%.

        In this command:

        * ``f4ce3623d74e771d`` is the long network address of Thingy:53.
        * ``42`` is the endpoint number for aggregating the clusters.
        * ``f4ce3655fc08bf6b`` is the long network address of the network coordinator device.
        * ``64`` is the endpoint number of the network coordinator device.
        * ``0x0402`` is the temperature cluster ID.
