nRF Desktop
###########

The nRF Desktop is a reference design of a HID device that is connected to a host through BLE or USB, or both.
Depending on the configuration, this application can function as a mouse, a gaming mouse, or a keyboard.

.. note::
    The code is currently work-in-progress and as such is not fully functional, verified, or supported for product development.

Overview
********

The nRF Desktop project supports common input HW interfaces like motion sensors, rotation sensors, and buttons scanning module.
The firmware can be configured at runtime using a dedicated configuration channel established with the HID feature report.
The same channel is used to transmit DFU packets.

.. _nrf_desktop_architecture:

Firmware architecture
=====================

The nRF Desktop application design aims at configurability and extensibility while being responsive.

The application architecture is modular and event-driven.
This means that parts of application functionality were separated into isolated modules that communicate with each other using application events.
Application events are handled by the :ref:`event_manager`.
Modules register themselves as listeners of events they need to react on.

The following figure shows the nRF Desktop modules and their relation with other components and the :ref:`event_manager`.

.. figure:: /images/nrf_desktop_arch.svg

See the following subsections for more information about the firmware architecture:

    * `Module usage per hardware type`_
    * `Thread usage`_
    * `Memory allocation`_

Module usage per hardware type
------------------------------

Since the application architecture is uniform and the code is shared, the set of modules in use depends on the selected device role.
A different set of modules is enabled when the application is working as a mouse, a keyboard, or as a dongle:

    * `Gaming mouse module set`_
    * `Desktop mouse module set`_
    * `Keyboard module set`_
    * `Dongle module set`_

Gaming mouse module set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following figure shows the modules enabled when the application is working as a gaming mouse.

   Application configured as a dongle (click to enlarge)

Thread usage
------------

The application limits the number of threads that are used to minimum and does not use the user-space threads.

The following threads are kept running in the application:

    * System-related threads
        * Idle thread
        * System workqueue thread
        * Logger thread (on debug build types)
        * Shell thread (on build types with shell enabled)
        * BLE-related threads (the exact number depends on the selected Link Layer)
    * Application-related threads
        * Motion sensor thread (running only on mouse)
        * Settings loading thread (enabled by default only on keyboard)
        * QoS data sampling thread (running only on dongle)

Most of the application activity takes place in the context of the system workqueue thread, either through scheduled work objects or through the event manager callbacks (executed from the system workqueue thread).
Because of this, the application does not need to handle resource protection.
The only exception are places where the interaction with interrupts or multiple threads cannot be avoided.

Memory allocation
-----------------

Most of the memory resources used by the application are allocated statically.

The application uses dynamic allocation for creating the event manager events.
For more information about events allocation, see :ref:`event_manager`.

.. note::
    When configuring HEAP, remember to set both :option:`CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE` and :option:`CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_MIN_SIZE` to match typical event size and the system needs.
    Zephyr's heap allocator works by dividing larger blocks into four smaller blocks.
    It is important to keep this in mind as this behavior impacts both the performance and the memory usage.
    For more information, refer to Zephyr's documentation at :ref:`heap_v2` and :ref:`memory_pools_v2`.

.. _nrf_desktop_porting_guide:

Integrating your own hardware
*****************************

This section describes how to adapt the nRF Desktop application to different hardware.
It describes the configuration sources that are used for the default configuration, and lists steps required for adding a new board:

    * `Configuration sources`_
    * `Board configuration`_

        * `nRF Desktop board configuration files`_

    * `Adding a new board`_

Configuration sources
=====================

The nRF Desktop project uses the following files as sources of its configuration:

    * DTS files -- reflect the hardware configuration (see :ref:`device-tree`).
    * ``_def`` files -- contain configuration arrays for the application modules and are specific to the nRF Desktop project.
    * Kconfig files -- reflect the software configuration (see :ref:`kconfig_tips_and_tricks`).

You must modify these configuration sources when `Adding a new board`_.
For information about differences between DTS files and Kconfig, see `Devicetree vs Kconfig`_.

Board configuration
===================

The nRF Desktop application is modular.
Depending on requested functions, it can provide mouse, keyboard, or dongle functionality.
The selection of modules depends on the chosen role and also on the selected board.
For more information about modules available for each configuration, see :ref:`nrf_desktop_architecture`.

For a board to be supported by the application, you must provide a set of configuration files at ``applications/nrf_desktop/configuration/your_board_name``.
The application configuration files define both a set of options with which the nRF Desktop project will be created for your board and the selected :ref:`nrf_desktop_build_types`.
Include the following files in this directory:

Mandatory configuration files
    * Application configuration file for the ``ZDebug`` build type.
    * Configuration files for the selected modules.

Optional configuration files
    * Application configuration files for other build types.
    * Configuration file for the bootloader.
    * DTS overlay file.

nRF Desktop board configuration files
-------------------------------------

The nRF Desktop project comes with configuration files for the following boards:

Gaming mouse (nrf52840_pca20041)
      * The board is defined in ``nrf/boards/arm/nrf52840_pca20041`` for the project-specific hardware.
      * To achieve gaming-grade performance:

        * The application is configured to act as a gaming mouse, with both BLE and USB transports enabled.
        * Bluetooth is configured to use Nordic's proprietary link layer.

      * |preconfigured_build_types|

Desktop mouse (nrf52_pca20044 and nrf52810_pca20045)
      * Both boards are meant for the project-specific hardware and are defined in ``nrf/boards/arm/nrf52_pca20044`` and ``nrf/boards/arm/nrf52810_pca20045``, respectively.
      * The application is configured to act as a mouse.
      * Only the Bluetooth Low Energy transport is enabled.
        Bluetooth uses Zephyr's software link layer.
      * There is no configuration with bootloader available.


Sample mouse or keyboard (nrf52840_pca10056)
      * The configuration uses the nRF52840 Development Kit.
      * The build types allow to build the application both as mouse and as keyboard.
      * Inputs are simulated based on the hardware button presses.
      * The configuration with bootloader is available.

Keyboard (nrf52_pca20037)
      * The board used is defined in ``nrf/boards/arm/nrf52_pca20037`` for the project-specific hardware.
      * The application is configured to act as a keyboard, with the BLE transport enabled.
      * Bluetooth is configured to use Nordic's proprietary link layer.
      * |preconfigured_build_types|

Dongle (nrf52840_pca10059)
      * This configuration uses Nordic's nRF52840 dongle defined in Zephyr.
      * Since the board is generic, project-specific changes are applied in the DTS overlay file.
      * The application is configured to act as both mouse and keyboard.
      * Bluetooth uses Nordic's proprietary link layer and is configured to act as a central.
        Input data comes from Bluetooth and is retransmitted to USB.
      * |preconfigured_build_types|

.. _porting_guide_adding_board:

Adding a new board
==================

When adding a new board for the first time, focus on a single configuration.
Moreover, keep the default ``ZDebug`` build type that the application is built with, and do not add any additional build type parameters.

.. note::
    The following procedure uses the gaming mouse configuration as an example.

To use the nRF Desktop project with your custom board:

1. Define the board by copying the nRF Desktop board files that are the closest match for your hardware.
   For example, for gaming mouse use ``nrf/boards/arm/nrf52840_pca20041``.
#. Edit the DTS files to make sure they match the hardware configuration.
   Pay attention to pins that are used and to the bus configuration for optical sensor.
#. Edit the board's Kconfig files to make sure they match the required system configuration.
   For example, disable the drivers that will not be used by your device.
#. Copy the project files for the device that is the closest match for your hardware.
   For example, for gaming mouse these are located at ``applications/nrf_desktop/configure/nrf52840_pca20041``.
#. Optionally, depending on the board, edit the DTS overlay file.
   This step is not required if you have created a new board and its DTS files fully describe your hardware.
   In such case, the overlay file can be left empty.
#. In Kconfig, ensure that the following modules that are specific for gaming mouse are enabled:

    * :ref:`motion`
    * :ref:`wheel`
    * :ref:`buttons`
    * :ref:`battery_meas`
    * :ref:`leds`

#. For each module enabled, change its ``_def`` file to match your hardware:

    * Motion module
        * The ``nrf52840_pca20041`` uses the PMW3360 optical motion sensor.
          The sensor is configured in DTS, and the sensor type is selected in the application configuration.
          To add a new sensor, expand the application configuration.
    * Wheel module
        * The wheel is based on the QDEC peripheral of the nRF52840 device and the hardware-related part is configured in DTS.
    * Buttons module
        * To simplify the configuration of arrays, the nRF Desktop project uses ``_def`` files.
        * The ``_def`` file of the buttons module contains pins assigned to rows and columns.
    * Battery measurement module
        * The ``_def`` file of the battery measurement module contains the mapping needed to match the voltage read from ADC to the battery level.
    * LEDs module
        * The application uses two logical LEDs -- one for the peers state, and one for the system state indication.
	* Each of the logical LEDs can have either one (monochromatic) or three color channels (RGB).
	  Such color channel is a physical LED.
        * The project uses PWM channels to control the brightness of each physical LED.
          The PWM peripheral must be configured in DTS files, and the ``_def`` file of the LEDs module must be configured to indicate which PWM channel is assigned to each LED color.
	  Ensure that PWM channels are correctly configured in DTS and PWM driver is enabled in Kconfig file.

#. Review Bluetooth options in Kconfig.
   Refer to the Bluetooth configuration page for the list of available options.
   Ensure that the Bluetooth role is configured appropriately.
   For mouse, it should be configured as peripheral.
#. Edit Kconfig to disable options that you do not use.
   Some options have dependencies that might not be needed when these options are disabled.
   For example, when the LEDs module is disabled, the PWM driver is not needed.

Requirements
************

The project comes with configuration files for the following boards:

    * |nRF52840DK| - a sample where the mouse is emulated using DK buttons
    * PCA20041 - nRF Desktop gaming mouse reference design
    * PCA20037 - nRF Desktop keyboard reference design
    * PCA20044 - nRF Desktop casual mouse reference design (nRF52832)
    * PCA20045 - nRF Desktop casual mouse reference design (nRF52810)
    * PCA10059 - nRF Desktop dongle reference design

The application was designed to allow easy porting to new hardware.
Check :ref:`nrf_desktop_porting_guide` for more information.

User interface
**************

The nRF Desktop devices provide user input to the host in the same way as other mice and keyboards, using the following connection options:

    * :ref:`nrf_desktop_usb`
    * :ref:`nrf_desktop_ble`

The nRF Desktop devices support additional operations, like firmware upgrade or configuration change.
The support is implemented through the :ref:`config_channel`.
The host can use dedicated Python scripts to exchange the data with an nRF Desktop peripheral.
For detailed information, see the ``hid_configurator`` documentation.


To save power behavior of a device can change in time. For more information refer to the following section:

    * `Power Management`_

.. _nrf_desktop_usb:

Connection through USB
======================

The nRF Desktop devices use the USB HID class.
No additional software or drivers are required.

An example of the device that uses the connection through USB is the nRF Desktop dongle.
It receives data from the peripherals connected through Bluetooth Low Energy and forwards the data to the host.

Battery-powered devices with rechargeable batteries are charged through USB.

The devices that are connected both wirelessly and through USB at the same time provide their input only through the USB connection.
If the device is disconnected from USB, it automatically switches to sending the data wirelessly using Bluetooth Low Energy.


.. _nrf_desktop_ble:

Connection through BLE
======================

When turned on, the nRF Desktop peripherals are advertising until they go to the suspended state or connect through Bluetooth.
The peripheral supports one wireless connection at a time, but it may be bonded with multiple peers.

The nRF Desktop Bluetooth Central device scans for all bonded peripherals that are not connected.
The scanning is interrupted when any device connected to the dongle through Bluetooth is in use.
Continuing the scanning in such scenario would cause report rate drop.

The scanning starts automatically when one of the bonded peers disconnects.
It also takes place periodically when a known peer is not connected.

The peripheral connection can be based on standard BLE connection parameters or on BLE with Low Latency Packet Mode (LLPM).
LLPM is a proprietary Bluetooth extension from Nordic Semiconductor.
It can be used only if it is supported by both connected devices (desktop mice do not support it).
LLPM enables sending data with high report rate (up to 1000 reports per second), which is not supported by the standard BLE.


BLE peer control
----------------

A connected BLE peer device can be controlled using predefined buttons or button combinations.
There are several peer operations available.

The application distinguishes between the following button press types:

    * Short -- Button pressed for less than 0.5 seconds.
    * Standard -- Button pressed for more than 0.5 seconds, but less than 5 seconds.
    * Long -- Button pressed for more than 5 seconds.
    * Double -- Button pressed twice in quick succession.

The peer operation states provide visual feedback through LEDs (if the device has LEDs).
Each of the states is represented by separate LED color and effect.
The LED colors and effects are described in the :file:``led_state_def.h`` file located in the board-specific directory in the application configuration folder.

The assignments of hardware interface elements depend on the device type:

    * `Gaming mouse`_
    * `Desktop mouse`_
    * `Keyboard`_
    * `Dongle`_

Gaming mouse
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following predefined hardware interface elements are assigned to peer control operations for the gaming mouse:

Hardware switch
    * The switch is located next to the optical sensor.
    * You can set the switch in the following positions:

        * Top position: Select the dongle peer.
        * Middle position: Select the BLE peers.
        * Bottom position: Mouse turned off.

      When the dongle peer is selected, the peer control is disabled until the switch is set to another position.

Precision Aim button
    * The button is located on the left side of the mouse, in the thumb area.
    * Short-press to initialize the peer selection.
      During the peer selection:

        1. Short-press to select the next peer.
        #. Double-press to confirm the peer selection.
           The peer is changed after the confirmation.

    * Long-press to initialize the peer erase, then double-press to confirm the operation.
      |nRF_Desktop_confirmation_effect|
    * |nRF_Desktop_cancel_operation|

Desktop mouse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following predefined buttons are assigned to peer control operations for the desktop mouse:

Scroll wheel button
    * Long-press to initialize and confirm the peer erase.
      The scroll must be pressed before the mouse is powered up.

        * |nRF_Desktop_confirmation_effect|

    * |nRF_Desktop_cancel_operation|

Keyboard
~~~~~~~~

The following predefined buttons or button combinations are assigned to peer control operations for the keyboard:

Page Down key
    * The Page Down key must be pressed while keeping the Fn modifier key pressed.
    * Short-press the Page Down key to initialize the peer selection.
      During the peer selection:

        1. Short-press to select the next peer.
        #. Double-press to confirm the peer selection.
           The peer is changed after the confirmation.

    * Long-press to initialize the peer erase, then double-press to confirm the operation.

        * |nRF_Desktop_confirmation_effect|

    * |nRF_Desktop_cancel_operation|

Dongle
~~~~~~

The following predefined buttons are assigned to peer control operations for the dongle:

SW1 button
    * Long-press to initialize peer erase, then double-press to confirm the operation.
      After the confirmation, all the Bluetooth bonds are removed.
    * Short-press to start scanning for both bonded and not bonded Bluetooth peripherals.
      The scan is interrupted if another peripheral connected to the dongle is in use.
    * |nRF_Desktop_cancel_operation|


Power Management
================

Reducing power consumption is important for every battery-powered device.

The nRF Desktop peripherals are either suspended or powered off when they are not in use for a predefined amount of time:

    * In the suspended state, the device maintains the active connection.
    * In the powered off state, the CPU is switched to the off mode.
    * In both cases, most of the functionalities are disabled.
      For example, LEDs are turned off and advertising is stopped.

The predefined amount of time can be specified in ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_POWER_MANAGER_TIMEOUT``, and by default it is set to 120 seconds.
Moving the mouse or pressing any button wakes up the device and turns on the disabled functionalities.

.. note::
    When the gaming mouse is powered from the USB, the power down timeout functionality is disabled.

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`applications/nrf_desktop`

The nRF Desktop application is built in the same way to any other NCS application or sample.

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt

When building the application, you can configure the project-specific build type.

.. _nrf_desktop_build_types:

Build types
===========

The build type enables you to select a set of configuration options without making changes to the ``.conf`` files.
Selecting build type is optional.
However, the ``ZDebug`` build type is used by default if no build type is explicitly selected.

The project supports the following build types:

    * ``ZRelease`` -- Release version of the application with no debugging features.
    * ``ZDebug`` -- Debug version of the application; the same as the ``ZRelease`` build type, but with debug options enabled.
    * ``ZDebugWithShell`` -- ``ZDebug`` build type with the shell enabled.
    * ``ZReleaseMCUBoot`` -- ``ZRelease`` build type with the support for MCUBoot enabled.
    * ``ZDebugMCUBoot`` -- ``ZDebug`` build type with the support for MCUBoot enabled.

Not every board mentioned in `Requirements`_ supports every build type.
If the given build type is not supported on the selected board, an error message will appear when building.
For example, if the ``ZDebugWithShell`` build type is not supported on the selected board, the following notification appears:

.. code-block:: console

  Configuration file for build type ZDebugWithShell is missing.

See :ref:`nrf_desktop_porting_guide` for detailed information about the application configuration.

Selecting build type in SES
---------------------------

To select the build type in SEGGER Embedded Studio:

1. Go to :guilabel:`Tools` -> :guilabel:`Options...` -> :guilabel:`nRF Connect`.
#. Set ``Additional CMake Options`` to ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=selected_build_type``.
   For example, for ``ZRelease`` set the following value: ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ZRelease``.
#. Reload the project.

The changes will be applied after reloading.

Selecting build type from command line
--------------------------------------

To select the build type when building the application from command line, specify the build type by adding the ``-- -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=selected_build_type`` to the ``west build`` command.
For example, you can build the ``ZRelease`` firmware for the PCA20041 board by running the following command in the ``applications/nrf_desktop`` directory:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf52840_pca20041 -d build_pca20041 -- -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ZRelease

The ``build_pca20041`` parameter specifies the output directory for the build files.

Testing
=======

The application may be built and tested in various configurations.
The following procedure refers to the scenario where the gaming mouse (PCA20041) and the keyboard (PCA20037) are connected simultaneously to the dongle (PCA10059).

After building the application with or without specifying the :ref:`nrf_desktop_build_types`, test the nRF Desktop application by performing the following steps:

1. Program the required firmware to each device.
#. Turn on both the mouse and the keyboard.
   The LED on the keyboard and the LED on the mouse (located under the logo) both start breathing.
#. Plug the dongle to the USB port.
   The blue LED on the dongle starts breathing.
   This indicates that the dongle is scanning for peripherals.
#. Wait for the establishment of the Bluetooth connection, which happens automatically.
   After the Bluetooth connection is established, the LEDs stop breathing and remain turned on.
   The devices can then be used simultaneously.

   .. note::
        You can manually start the scanning for new peripheral devices by pressing the `SW1` button on the dongle for a short time.
        This might be needed if the dongle does not connect with all the peripherals before timeout.
        The scanning is interrupted after a predefined amount of time, because it negatively affects the performance of already connected peripherals.

#. Move the mouse and press any key on the keyboard.
   The input is reflected on the host.

    .. note::
        When a configuration with debug features is enabled, for example the logger and assertions, the gaming mouse report rate can be significantly lower.

        Make sure that you use the release configurations before testing the mouse report rate.
        For the release configurations, you should observe a 500-Hz report rate when both mouse and keyboard are connected and a 1000-Hz rate when only mouse is connected.

#. Switch the Bluetooth peer on the gaming mouse by pressing the Precise Aim button.
   The gaming mouse LED color changes from red to green and the LED starts blinking rapidly.
#. Press the Precise Aim button twice quickly to confirm the selection.
   After the confirmation, the LED starts breathing and the mouse starts the Bluetooth advertising.
#. Connect to the mouse with an Android phone, a laptop, or any other Bluetooth Central.
   After the connection is established, you can use the mouse with the connected device.
