.. _nrf_desktop_dev_descr:

Device description module
#########################

The ``dev_descr`` module defines custom GATT Service, which contains information about whether the peripheral supports the Low Latency Packet Mode (LLPM).
Only the nrfxlib Link Layer (:option:`CONFIG_BT_LL_NRFXLIB`) supports the LLPM extension.
The Service is mandatory for all nRF Desktop peripherals that connect to the nRF Desktop centrals.

Module Events
*************

The module does not submit any event nor subscribe for any event.

Configuration
*************

The module is enabled by default for all Bluetooth peripheral devices.

``dev_descr.h`` file contains the UUIDs used by the custom GATT Service.
The file is located in the ``configuration/common`` directory.
The UUIDs must be the same for all peripheral devices to ensure that the central is able to read information about the LLPM support.

Implementation details
**********************

The module uses :c:macro:`BT_GATT_SERVICE_DEFINE` to define the custom GATT Service.
More detailed information regarding GATT are available in Zephyr documentation (:ref:`zephyr:bt_gatt`).
