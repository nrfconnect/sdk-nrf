USB state module
################

The |usb_state| is responsible for tracking the USB connection.
It is also responsible for transmitting data over the USB on the application's device.

Module Events
*************

.. include:: event_propagation.rst
    :start-after: table_usb_state_start
    :end-before: table_usb_state_end

See the :ref:`nrf_desktop_architecture` for more information about the event-based communication in the nRF Desktop application and about how to read this table.

Configuration
*************

The module is enabled by selecting ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_USB_ENABLE``.
It depends on :option:`CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_HID`.

When enabling the USB support for the device, set the following generic device options:

 * :option:`CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_MANUFACTURER` - Manufacturer's name
 * :option:`CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_PRODUCT` - Product name
 * :option:`CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_VID` - Vendor ID (VID) number
 * :option:`CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_PID` - Product ID (PID) number

For low latency devices, make sure that the device requests a polling rate of 1 ms by setting :option:`CONFIG_USB_HID_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` to ``1``.

If the device is meant to support the boot protocol, select :option:`CONFIG_USB_HID_BOOT_PROTOCOL` and make sure :option:`CONFIG_USB_HID_PROTOCOL_CODE` chooses either the mouse or the keyboard code.

Implementation details
**********************

The |usb_state| registers the HID-class USB device and initializes the USB subsystem.

The necessary callbacks are connected to the module to ensure that the state of the USB connection is tracked.
From the application's viewpoint, the USB can be in the following states, which are broadcast by the |usb_state| with a ``usb_state_event``:

 * USB_STATE_DISCONNECTED - USB cable is not connected.
 * USB_STATE_POWERED - The device is powered from the USB but is not configured for the communication.
 * USB_STATE_ACTIVE - The device is ready to exchange data with the host.
 * USB_STATE_SUSPENDED - The host has requested the device to enter the suspended state.

When the device is connected to the host and configured for the communication, the module will broadcast ``USB_STATE_ACTIVE`` state with a ``usb_state_event``.
The module will also subscribe to all HID reports available in the application for the selected protocol.

When the device is disconnected from the host, the module will unsubscribe from the HID reports.

When the HID report data is transmitted through ``hid_report_event``, the module will pass it to the associated endpoint.
Upon data delivery, ``hid_report_sent_event`` is submitted by the module.

.. note::
  Only one report can be transmitted by the module at any given time.

.. warning::
  Writing to an endpoint is a blocking operation.

The |usb_state| is a transport for :ref:`nrf_desktop_config_channel` when the channel is enabled.
