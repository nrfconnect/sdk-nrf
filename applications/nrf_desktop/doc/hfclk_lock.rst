High frequency clock lock hotfix module

Use the high frequency clock lock hotfix module to keep the high frequency clock enabled.
This reduces the latency before the first packet in a row is transmitted over Bluetooth®, but it also increases the power consumption.
If this module is disabled, a startup delay of around 1.5 ms will be added to the overall latency of the first packet.

Configuration
*************

Enable the module with the :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_HFCLK_LOCK_ENABLE <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option.

Implementation details
**********************

The high frequency clock is disabled on ``power_down_event`` and reenabled on ``wake_up_event``.
This is done to reduce the power consumption.
