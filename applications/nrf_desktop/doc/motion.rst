Motion module
#############

The ``motion`` module is responsible for generating events related to movement.
The movement can be detected using the motion sensor, but it can also be sourced from
GPIO pins or simulated.

Module Events
*************

.. include:: event_propagation.rst
    :start-after: table_motion_start
    :end-before: table_motion_end

See the :ref:`nrf_desktop_architecture` for more information about the event-based communication in the nRF Desktop application and about how to read this table.

Configuration
*************

The ``motion`` module selects the source of movement based on the following configuration options:
    * ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_NONE`` - module is disabled.
    * ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_SENSOR_PMW3360_ENABLE`` - movement data is obtained from gaming grade ``PMW3360`` motion sensor.
    * ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_SENSOR_PAW3212_ENABLE`` - movement data is obtained from ``PAW3212`` motion sensor.
    * ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_BUTTONS_ENABLE`` - movement data is generated using buttons.
    * ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_SIMULATED_ENABLE`` - movement data is simulated (controlled from the Zephyr shell).

Each option is described in detail further below.

Depending on the selected configuration option, different implementation file is used during
the build process.

Motion sensors
==============

Selecting either of the motion sensors (``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_SENSOR_PMW3360_ENABLE``
or ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_SENSOR_PAW3212_ENABLE``) adds the ``src/hw_interface/motion_sensor.c`` file
to the compilation.

The motion sensor is sampled from the context of a dedicated thread.
The option ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_SENSOR_THREAD_STACK_SIZE`` is used to set the
thread's stack size.

The motion sensor default sensitivity and power saving switching times can be set with the following options:
    * ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_SENSOR_CPI`` - default CPI.
    * ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_SENSOR_SLEEP1_TIMEOUT_MS`` - ``Sleep 1`` mode default switch time.
    * ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_SENSOR_SLEEP2_TIMEOUT_MS`` - ``Sleep 2`` mode default switch time.
    * ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_SENSOR_SLEEP3_TIMEOUT_MS`` - ``Sleep 3`` mode default switch time.

For more information, see the sensor documentation and Kconfig.

Buttons
=======

Selecting the ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_BUTTONS_ENABLE`` option adds the ``src/hw_interface/motion_buttons.c`` file to the compilation.

Simulated
=========

Selecting the ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_SIMULATED_ENABLE`` option adds the ``src/hw_interface/motion_simulated.c`` file to the compilation.
This option depends on the shell (``CONFIG_DESKTOP_SHELL_ENABLE`` option) to be
enabled in the application configuration.

When using this option the ``motion`` module registers a shell module ``motion_sim``
and links to it two commands: ``start`` and ``stop``.

When started, the module will generate simulated motion events. Movement data
in each event will be tracing the predefined path, an eight-sided polygon.

You can configure the path with the following options:
    * ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_SIMULATED_EDGE_TIME`` - sets how long each edge is traced.
    * ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_SIMULATED_SCALE_FACTOR`` - scales the size of the polygon.

The ``stop`` command will cause the module to stop generating :new events.

Implementation details
**********************

This section describes the ``motion`` module implementation for motion
sensors.

Motion sensor
=============

The ``motion`` module samples movement data from the motion sensor using the motion
sensor driver.
The name of the device linked with the driver changes depending on the selected sensor.
The same is true for the names of sensor configuration options.
The ``nrf_desktop`` application aggregates the sensor-specific information and
translates them to the application abstracts in the
``configuration/common/motion_sensor.h`` header file.

Sampling thread
===============

The ``motion`` module uses a dedicated sampling thread to sample data from the motion
sensor. The reason for using the sampling thread is the long time required for
data to be ready. Using a dedicated thread also simplifies the module, because the interaction
with the sensor becomes sequential. The sampling thread priority is set to 0
(the highest preemptive thread priority), because it is assumed that the data
sampling will happen in the background.

The sampling thread stays in the unready state blocked on a semaphore. The semaphore
is triggered when the motion sensor trigger sends a notification that the data is available or
when other application event requires the module interaction with the sensor
(for example, when configuration is submitted from the host).

Sampling pipeline
=================

The ``motion`` module starts in ``STATE_DISABLED`` and after initialization
enters ``STATE_DISCONNECTED``. When disconnected, the module is not generating
motion events, but the motion sensor is sampled to make sure its registers are cleared.

Upon connection, the ``motion`` module switches to the ``STATE_IDLE`` state, in which
the module waits for the motion sensor trigger.

When a first motion is detected and
the device is connected to a host (meaning it can transmit the HID data out), the module switches
to ``STATE_FETCHING``, samples the motion data and submits the ``motion_event``.
The ``motion`` module then waits for indication that the ``motion_event`` data
was transmitted to the host. This is done when the module receives the
``hid_report_sent_event`` event. At that moment, a next motion sampling is
performed and the next ``motion_event`` sent.

The module continues to sample data until disconnection or when there is no
motion detected. The ``motion`` module assumes no motion when ``CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_SENSOR_EMPTY_SAMPLES_COUNT`` consecutive
samples return zero on both axis. In such case, the module will switch back to
``STATE_IDLE`` and wait for the motion sensor trigger.
