	  The HID report queue utility can be used to enqueue HID reports from
	  connected HID peripherals. The queue simplifies integrating new
	  modules that receive HID reports from peripherals.

	  On the HID peripheral, the HID state module is used as a source of HID
	  input reports. The HID state module does not use the HID report queue
	  utility.
