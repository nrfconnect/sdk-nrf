	  This option can be used to synchronize timestamps for profiler events
	  on two devices.

	  When this option is enabled nRF Desktop devices generate profiler
	  event (sync_event) that is used for synchronization. Central generates
	  square wave using GPIO, peripheral reacts on the edges. Make sure that
	  selected pins of the central and the peripheral are connected
	  together.
