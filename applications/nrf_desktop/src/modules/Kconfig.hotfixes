	bool "Keep HF clock enabled"
	help
	  Keeping the HF clock enabled is needed to reduce the latency before
	  the first packet (in a row) is transmitted over the BLE.
	  If disabled a startup delay of around 1.5 ms will be added to
	  overall latency of the first packet.
	  If enabled current consumption is increased.
