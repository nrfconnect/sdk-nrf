config DESKTOP_HFCLK_LOCK_ENABLE
	bool "Keep HF clock enabled [DEPRECATED]"
	depends on !SOC_SERIES_NRF54HX
	select DEPRECATED
	help
	  The HF clock needs to be enabled during data transmission over BLE.
	  Enabling the HF clock right before the data transmission adds an extra
	  latency of around 1.4 ms (0.85 ms in case of nRF54L Series SoCs) for
	  the first packet (in a row) that is transmitted. The extra latency is
	  caused by the HF clock startup latency. Keeping the HF clock enabled
	  all the time removes the extra latency caused by the clock startup at
	  the cost of increased power consumption.

	  The HF clock lock hotfix is not supported for nRF54H Series SoCs. For
	  these SoCs, a part of the Bluetooth stack runs on the radio core.
	  Keeping the HF clock enabled by the application running on application
	  core does not mitigate the extra HID report latency caused by the HF
	  clock startup, because the application cannot notify a part of the
	  Bluetooth stack running on the radio core that HF clock is already
	  enabled. The clock startup latency unconditionally affects the first
	  transmitted packet.

	  The hotfix is deprecated and will be removed in the future. Use the
	  CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_LOW_LATENCY_LOCK instead. Setting the peripheral
	  latency LLPM connection parameter to `0` on a peripheral leads to
	  keeping the HF clock enabled. That mitigates the extra HID report
	  latency caused by the HF clock startup delay.

config DESKTOP_CONSTLAT_ENABLE
	bool "Constant latency interrupts"
	depends on !SOC_SERIES_NRF54LX
	depends on !SOC_SERIES_NRF54HX
	select NRFX_POWER
	help
	  When enabled, the SoC uses configuration for constant latency
	  interrupts. This reduces interrupt propagation time but increases
	  power consumption.

	  Currently, the nRF54L Series SoCs do not support the nrfx POWER driver
	  (CONFIG_NRFX_POWER). Because of that, the hotfix cannot be used by
	  these SoCs.

	  nRF54H Series SoCs do not enable constant latency interrupts through
	  the nrfx POWER driver. This SoC series is currently not supported
	  by the hotfix.

config DESKTOP_CONSTLAT_DISABLE_ON_STANDBY
	bool "Disable constant latency interrupts on standby"
	depends on CAF_PM_EVENTS
	depends on DESKTOP_CONSTLAT_ENABLE
	help
	  When enabled constant latency interrupts will be disabled when
	  the devices switches to standby.
