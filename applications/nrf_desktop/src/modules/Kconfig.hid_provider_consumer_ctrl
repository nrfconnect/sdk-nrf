	  If a keypress is recorded before HID subscriber connects, it is stored
	  in HID event queue and processed after the subscriber connects. This
	  Kconfig option specifies time after which a queued keypress will be
	  considered expired. The higher the value, the longer the period from
	  which the module will recall pressed keys when the connection with HID
	  host is established.

	  The first default is deprecated and used for backwards compatibility.

	help
	  The option limits the number of keypresses (button press or release)
	  on the HID event queue where the keypresses are stored before the
	  connection with HID host is established. If there is no space in the
	  queue to enqueue a new key state change, the oldest element is
	  released.

	  The first default is deprecated and used for backwards compatibility.
