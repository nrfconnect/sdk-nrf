	bool "Enable user configuration channel"
	select DESKTOP_HWID
	help
	  Enables user to change firmware parameters at runtime over the
	  configuration channel.

config DESKTOP_CONFIG_CHANNEL_OUT_REPORT

	depends on DESKTOP_CONFIG_CHANNEL_ENABLE
	depends on DESKTOP_ROLE_HID_PERIPHERAL
	help
	  Use additional HID output report for configuration channel data
	  transfer. The HID output report is used only by nRF Desktop dongle,
	  other hosts use the HID feature report.

	  For HID output reports, the dongle can use write without response.
	  In that case LLPM peripheral does not have to respond instead of
	  providing HID notification during one connection event.

	  Using HID output report prevents report rate drops when forwarding
	  configuration channel data, but it increases memory consumption of
	  the peripheral.

	  The config channel HID output report is handled in a dedicated way.
	  It does not use the same infrastructure as other HID output reports.

	  performs progress synchronization the data is moved from RAM to flash.
	  The host must perform progress synchronization at least
	  every synchronization buffer bytes count.
