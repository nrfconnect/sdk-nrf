config DESKTOP_CONFIG_CHANNEL_ENABLE
	bool "Enable user configuration channel"
	select DESKTOP_HWID
	help
	  Enables user to change firmware parameters at runtime over the
	  configuration channel.

config DESKTOP_CONFIG_CHANNEL_OUT_REPORT
	bool "Enable additional HID output report"
	depends on DESKTOP_CONFIG_CHANNEL_ENABLE
	depends on DESKTOP_ROLE_HID_PERIPHERAL
	help
	  Use additional HID output report for configuration channel data
	  transfer. The HID output report is used only by nRF Desktop dongle,
	  other hosts use the HID feature report.

	  For HID output reports, the dongle can use write without response.
	  In that case LLPM peripheral does not have to respond instead of
	  providing HID notification during one connection event.

	  Using HID output report prevents report rate drops when forwarding
	  configuration channel data, but it increases memory consumption of
	  the peripheral.

	  The config channel HID output report is handled in a dedicated way.
	  It does not use the same infrastructure as other HID output reports.

config DESKTOP_CONFIG_CHANNEL_TIMEOUT
	int "Transaction timeout on configuration channel in seconds"
	depends on DESKTOP_CONFIG_CHANNEL_ENABLE
	default 10
	help
	  Timeout [s] after which config channel transaction is dropped.

	depends on DESKTOP_CONFIG_CHANNEL_ENABLE
	depends on (SSF_SUIT_SERVICE_ENABLED || !SUIT)
	help
	  This option enables DFU over the config channel.
	  The option automatically enables 8-bit write block size emulation to
	  ensure that update images with size unaligned to word size can be
	  handled while writing to SoC FLASH.

config DESKTOP_CONFIG_CHANNEL_DFU_SYNC_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Size (in words) of sync buffer"
	range 1 16383
	default 128
	help
	  Number of words DFU data synchronization buffer will use. The new
	  image data is first transmitted to this RAM located buffer. When host
	  performs progress synchronization the data is moved from RAM to flash.
	  The host must perform progress synchronization at least
	  every synchronization buffer bytes count.

config DESKTOP_CONFIG_CHANNEL_DFU_MCUBOOT_DIRECT_XIP
	bool "Device uses MCUboot bootloader in direct-xip mode"
	depends on BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT
	default y if MCUBOOT_BOOTLOADER_MODE_DIRECT_XIP
	help
	  The option informs the DFU module that the MCUboot bootloader supports
	  direct-xip mode. In this mode, the image is booted directly from the
	  secondary slot instead of moving it to the primary slot. The module by
	  default assumes that MCUboot with direct-xip is used when direct-xip
	  variant image is built.

	  The DFU module assumes that MCUboot direct-xip bootloader simply boots
	  the image with a higher version. The module does not mark the newly
	  uploaded image as pending nor confirm it after a successful boot.

config DESKTOP_CONFIG_CHANNEL_DFU_VID

	default DESKTOP_DEVICE_VID
	help
	  Configuration channel allows devices to report their Vendor ID. The
	  Vendor ID is reported together with Product ID and device generation.

	  The information is useful if nRF Desktop peripheral is connected
	  through nRF Desktop dongle and host computer has no direct access to
	  the VID and PID.

config DESKTOP_CONFIG_CHANNEL_DFU_PID
	hex "Configuration channel Product ID"
	range 0 0XFFFF
	default DESKTOP_DEVICE_PID
	help
	  Configuration channel allows devices to report their Product ID. The
	  Product ID is reported together with Vendor ID and device generation.

	  The information is useful if nRF Desktop peripheral is connected
	  through nRF Desktop dongle and host computer has no direct access to
	  the VID and PID.

config DESKTOP_CONFIG_CHANNEL_DFU_GENERATION

	  Configuration channel allows devices to report their generation. The
