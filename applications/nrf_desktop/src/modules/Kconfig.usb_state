	  Enables USB module. The module allows to transfer HID reports over

	  possible priority.

	help
	  By default, every USB HID instance subscribes for all the HID reports.
	  Enable this option to specify a subset of HID reports for every USB
	  HID instance. The subset of HID reports must be specified in

	help
	  Delay submitting hid_report_sent_event until subsequent USB Start of
	  Frame (SOF). The feature reduces the negative impact of jitter related
	  to USB polls. However, it also increases HID data latency, as a HID
	  report pipeline with two sequential reports is required to ensure that
	  the USB peripheral can provide a HID report on every USB poll.

	  By default, dongle uses a dedicated USB HID instance to forward data
	  from given peripheral to the host. On memory-limited dongles, a
	  single USB HID instance can be used to forward HID reports from all
	  of the connected peripherals.

	  By default, peripheral uses a single USB HID instance to send all of
	  the HID reports.

	help
	  nRF Desktop queues HID reports at the source. Generally there is no
	  need to use multiple buffers in the IN pool per HID instance.

	  An exception is use-case where HID reports are submitted from USB sent
	  callback (when synchronizing hid_report_sent to USB Start of Frame
	  (SOF) enforces using pipeline size of 2). An extra buffer must be
	  allocated to allow providing data to the USB next stack before the
	  previously allocated buffer is freed.

	help
	  Disable the USB stack on VBUS removal and enable it on VBUS ready to
	  workaround UDC driver limitations of the nRF54HX SoC.

	  After the USB cable is removed, the USB driver is powered down and
	  doesn't call appropriate callbacks to the USB stack. It may lead to
	  the USB stack ending in a broken state. Calling usbd_disable() on VBUS
	  removal workarounds this issue.

	  The usbd_enable() function blocks until USB cable is connected. If the
	  cable is not connected during the predefined wait period
	  (CONFIG_UDC_DWC2_USBHS_VBUS_READY_TIMEOUT), the function returns
	  earlier with a timeout error. The function is called on VBUS ready to
	  avoid calling usbd_enable() periodically.

config UDC_DWC2_USBHS_VBUS_READY_TIMEOUT
	int
	depends on SOC_SERIES_NRF54HX
	default 100
	help
	  For the nRF54HX SoC the timeout must be set to a non-zero value to

	  forever when the USB cable is not connected.
