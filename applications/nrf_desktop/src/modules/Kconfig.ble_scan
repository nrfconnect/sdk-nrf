config BT_SCAN_NAME_CNT
	default 2
	help
	  The nRF Desktop by default uses two name filters. The peripheral
	  device may advertise either as mouse or as keyboard.

config BT_SCAN_ADDRESS_CNT
	default BT_MAX_PAIRED
	help
	  The nRF Desktop needs an address filter per every bonded peripheral.

config BT_SCAN_CONN_ATTEMPTS_FILTER
	default y
	help
	  The connection attempts filter is enabled by default to limit number
	  of attempts to connect to the device.

config DESKTOP_BLE_SCAN_START_TIMEOUT_S
	int "Scan start timeout [s]"
	default 5
	help
	  After disabled, scanning is re-enabled after defined time of connected
	  peripherals inactivity (scanning has negative impact on user
	  experience - e.g. may cause mouse pointer lags).

	  After this time scan is disabled if any peripheral is connected.

	int "Forced scan duration [s]"
	default 4
	help
	  Duration of the forced scan operation in seconds. The module enters a
	  forced scan state right after boot or wakeup, on successful peripheral
	  discovery, on peripheral disconnection and on connection failure.

	  Setting forced scan duration to 0 disables the feature.

	help
	  Stop and block scanning for peers if the central switched to the power down mode
	  to reduce power consumption.
