	help
	  Enable BLE latency module that controls Bluetooth LE connection
	  latency. The module lowers the connection latency when configuration
	  channel is in use or when firmware update is received by SMP (low
	  latency ensures quick data exchange).

	  The module also keeps the connection latency low for LLPM connections
	  to improve performance and disconnects Bluetooth peer if connection
	  has not been secured in the predefined amount of time after the
	  connection occurred.

	  After this time peripheral device disconnects if security is not
	  established.

	help
	  When this option is selected, the slave latency is kept low
	  for the LLPM connection unless device is in low power mode. This
	  speeds up sending the first HID report after not sending a report for
	  some connection intervals. Enabling this option increases the power
	  consumption of the device.
