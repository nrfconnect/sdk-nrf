	  If this option is disabled the data module will only include device configuration values
	  that have changed from the last configuration update. This is to save costs related to
	  data transfers and to lower the device's overall current consumption due to less CPU and
	  radio-activity.

config DATA_GPS_BUFFER_COUNT
	int "Number of GPS data ringbuffer entries"
	range 1 100
	default 10
	help
	  Currently, the range for ringbuffer entries is limited to a minimum of 1 and a
	  maximum of 100. A minimum of 1 is set to make sure that the application builds with the
	  current implementation of the data module. The buffers are essentially arrays of a
	  certain data type and arrays cannot be compiled with a count of 0.
	  The Kconfig range statement requires that a maximum value is also set.
	  The maximum value of 100 is an arbitrary number that can be increased if desired.
	  Note that when increasing the maximum count of a buffer there is no guarantee beyond
	  using the default values that there is enough heap memory to successfully encode
	  enqueued entries into a JSON object string.
