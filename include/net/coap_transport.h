 * @brief The transport interface that the CoAP depends on for sending and
 *        receiving CoAP messages.
 *
 * @details While the interface is well defined and should not be altered, the
 *          implementation of the interface depends on the choice of IP stack.
 *          The only exception to this is the \ref coap_transport_read API.
 *          This API is implemented in the CoAP, and the transport layer is
 *          expected to call this function when data is received on one of the
 *          CoAP ports.
