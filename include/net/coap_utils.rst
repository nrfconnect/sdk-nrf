CoAP utils
##########

The CoAP utils library is a simple module that enables communication with devices that support the CoAP protocol.
It allows sending and receiving non-confirmable CoAP requests.

Overview
********

The library uses :ref:`CoAP <zephyr:coap_sock_interface>` and :ref:`BSD socket API <bsd_sockets_interface>`.

After calling :c:func:`coap_init`, the library opens a socket for receiving UDP packets for IPv4 or IPv6 connections, depending on the ``ip_family`` parameter.
At this point, you can start sending CoAP non-confirmable requests, to which you will receive answers depending on the server configuration.

Limitations
***********

Currently, the library only supports the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) protocol.

Configuration
*************

To enable the CoAP utils library, set the :option:`CONFIG_COAP_UTILS` Kconfig option.
