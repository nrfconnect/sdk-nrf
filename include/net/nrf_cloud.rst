.. _lib_nrf_cloud:

nRF Cloud
#########

The nRF Cloud library enables applications to connect to Nordic Semiconductor's `nRF Cloud`_.
It abstracts and hides the details of the transport and the encoding scheme that is used for the payload and provides a simplified API interface for sending data from supported sensor types to the cloud.
The current implementation supports the following technology:

* GPS and FLIP sensor data
* TLS secured MQTT as communication protocol
* JSON as data format

.. _lib_nrf_cloud_init:

Initializing
************
Before using any other APIs of the module, the application must call :cpp:func:`nrf_cloud_init`.
If this API fails, the application must not use any APIs of the module.

.. note::
   Initialize the module before starting any timers, sensor drivers, or communication on the link.

.. _lib_nrf_cloud_connect:

Connecting
**********
The application can use :cpp:func:`nrf_cloud_connect` to connect to the cloud.
This API triggers a series of events and actions in the system.
If the API fails, the application must retry to connect.

First, the library tries to establish the transport for communicating with the cloud.
This procedure involves a TLS handshake that might take up to three seconds.
The API blocks for the duration of the handshake.

Next, the API subscribes to an MQTT topic to start receiving user association requests from the cloud.
The cloud uses the device's certificates for authentication.
See `nRF Connect for Cloud Certificate Update`_ and the :ref:`modem_key_mgmt` library for more information on modem credentials.
The certificates are generated using the device's ID and PIN/HWID.

Every time nRF Cloud starts a communication session with a device, it verifies whether the device is uniquely associated with a user.
If not, the user association procedure is triggered.
When adding the device to an nRF cloud account, the user must provide the correct device ID and PIN (for Thingy:91) or HWID (for nRF9160 DK) to nRF Cloud.

The following message sequence chart shows the flow of events and expected application responses to each event during the user association procedure:

.. msc::
   hscale = "1.3";
   Module,Application;
   Module<<Application      [label="nrf_cloud_connect() returns successfully"];
   Module>>Application      [label="NRF_CLOUD_EVT_TRANSPORT_CONNECTED"];
   Module>>Application      [label="NRF_CLOUD_EVT_USER_ASSOCIATION_REQUEST"];
    ---                     [label="Add the device to nRF Cloud account"];
   Module>>Application      [label="NRF_CLOUD_EVT_USER_ASSOCIATED"];
   Module<<Application      [label="nrf_cloud_disconnect() returns successfully"];
   Module>>Application      [label="NRF_CLOUD_EVT_TRANSPORT_DISCONNECTED"];
   Module<<Application      [label="nrf_cloud_connect() returns successfully"];
   Module>>Application      [label="NRF_CLOUD_EVT_TRANSPORT_CONNECTED"];
   Module>>Application      [label="NRF_CLOUD_EVT_USER_ASSOCIATED"];
   Module>>Application      [label="NRF_CLOUD_EVT_READY"];


.. note::
   This chart shows the sequence of successful user association of an unassociated device.
   Currently, nRF Cloud requires that communication is re-established to update the device's permission to send user data.
   The application must disconnect using :cpp:func:`nrf_cloud_disconnect` and then reconnect using :cpp:func:`nrf_cloud_connect`.

When the device is successfully associated with a user on the cloud, subsequent connections to the cloud (also across power cycles) follow this sequence:

.. msc::
   hscale = "1.3";
   Module,Application;
   Module<<Application      [label="nrf_cloud_connect() returns successfully"];
   Module>>Application      [label="NRF_CLOUD_EVT_TRANSPORT_CONNECTED"];
   Module>>Application      [label="NRF_CLOUD_EVT_USER_ASSOCIATED"];
   Module>>Application      [label="NRF_CLOUD_EVT_READY"];

After receiving :cpp:enumerator:`NRF_CLOUD_EVT_READY`, the application can start sending sensor data to the cloud.

.. _lib_nrf_cloud_data:

Sending sensor data
*******************
The library offers two APIs, :cpp:func:`nrf_cloud_sensor_data_send` and :cpp:func:`nrf_cloud_sensor_data_stream`, for sending sensor data to the cloud.
Currently, the supported sensor types are GPS and FLIP (see :cpp:enum:`nrf_cloud_sensor`).

Use :cpp:func:`nrf_cloud_sensor_data_stream` to send sensor data with best quality.

Before sending any sensor data, call the function :cpp:func:`nrf_cloud_sensor_attach` with the type of the sensor.
Note that this function must be called after receiving the event :cpp:enumerator:`NRF_CLOUD_EVT_READY`.
It triggers the event :cpp:enumerator:`NRF_CLOUD_EVT_SENSOR_ATTACHED` if the execution was successful.

.. _lib_nrf_cloud_unlink:

Removing the link between device and user
*****************************************
If you want to remove the link between a device and an nRF Cloud user, you must do this from the nRF Cloud.
It is not possible for a device to unlink itself.

When a user disassociates a device, the library disallows any further sensor data to be sent to the cloud and generates an :cpp:enumerator:`NRF_CLOUD_EVT_USER_ASSOCIATION_REQUEST` event.
The application can then decide to associate again by responding with :cpp:func:`nrf_cloud_user_associate` with the new input sequence.
See the following message sequence chart:

.. msc:
   hscale = "1.3";
   Module,Application;
   Module>>Application      [label="NRF_CLOUD_EVT_USER_ASSOCIATION_REQUEST"];
   Module<<Application      [label="nrf_cloud_user_associate()"];
   Module>>Application      [label="NRF_CLOUD_EVT_USER_ASSOCIATED"];
   Module>>Application      [label="NRF_CLOUD_EVT_READY"];
   Module>>Application      [label="NRF_CLOUD_EVT_TRANSPORT_DISCONNECTED"];
