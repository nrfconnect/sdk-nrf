Generic Power OnOff Client
##########################

The Generic Power OnOff Client model remotely controls the state of a Generic Power OnOff Server model.

The Generic Power OnOff Client may send messages to both the Generic Power OnOff Server and the Generic Power OnOff Setup server, as long as it has the right application keys.
