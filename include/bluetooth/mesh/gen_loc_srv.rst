Generic Location Server
#######################

   :depth: 2

The Generic Location Server provides location information about the device.
The location data is split up into the following separate states: Global and Local.

* Global Location represents the device location in the world.
* Local Location represents the device location relative to a local coordinate system, for instance inside a building.

The Generic Location Server adds the following model instances in the composition data:

- The Generic Location Server
- The Generic Location Setup Server

These model instances share the states of the Generic Location Server, but accept different messages.
This allows for a fine-grained control of the access rights for the location states, as the two model instances can be bound to different application keys:

* The Generic Location Server allows observation of the location states, as it only exposes get-messages for the location states.
  This is typically the user-facing model instance, as the device location shouldn't normally be configurable by the users.
* The Generic Location Setup Server allows configuration of the location states by exposing set-messages for the location states.
  This model instance can be used to configure the location information of the device, for instance during deployment.

If the device is capable of determining its own location information, the Generic Location Setup Server is redundant, and can be deactivated by removing all its bindings to application keys.

.. note::

  The Generic Location Server does not store any of its states persistently.
  If the Generic Location Server is to get its location configured during setup, this must be stored by the application.

States
======

The Generic Location Server model contains the following states:

Global Location: :c:struct:`bt_mesh_loc_global`
    The Global Location state is a composite state representing a global location as a WGS84 coordinate point.

    * The latitude and longitude (in degrees) are represented as a ``double``, and are each encoded as a signed 32-bit integer.
    * The altitude is represented as a signed 16-bit integer, measured in meters.

    The memory for the Global Location state is owned by the application, and should be exposed to the model through the callbacks in a :c:struct:`bt_mesh_loc_srv_handlers` structure.

Local Location: :c:struct:`bt_mesh_loc_local`
    The Local Location state represents the device's location within a locally defined coordinate system, like the interior of a building.
    The state contains the following parameters:

    * Three-dimensional device location measured in decimeters
    * Floor number
    * Parameters to determine the precision of the location parameters

    The memory for the Local Location state is owned by the user, and should be exposed to the model through the callbacks in a :c:struct:`bt_mesh_loc_srv_handlers` structure.
