Generic Default Transition Time models
######################################

The Generic Default Transition Time (DTT) models are used to control the transition of any other states on the same element as the DTT Server.
The DTT Client can remotely control the default transition time state of a server.

The DTT models only use native types, and have no common model-specific types.
