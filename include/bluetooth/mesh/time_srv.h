 * changes the respons uptime will reflect the input local time added

 * Example: A time zone change is scheduled 12:00:00 a clock an arbitrary
 * day to set the local clock forward by one hour. If the user requests

 * situation where some points in time never will on the local timeline.
 * If the user where to input a local time that is affected by these
 * changes the respons uptime will reflect the local time instance that
 * happens last.
 * Example: A time zone change is scheduled 12:00:00 a clock an arbitrary
