 * When the prepare callback is used to provide data to the Bluetooth stack,

 *
 * When used with a peripheral connection, the prepare distance also needs to take
 * clock drift into account to avoid that the callback triggers too late.
 * The clock drift is determined by the distance between packets and the clock
 * accuracy of both the central and the peripheral.
 * The Bluetooth specification allows a worst case clock accurary of 500 ppm.
 * That gives a worst case combined clock accurary of 1000 ppm.
 * This results in 1 ms drift per second.

 * See Bluetooth Core_v5.4, Vol 6, Part 4.2.4 for more details on clock drift.
