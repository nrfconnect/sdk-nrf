GATT DFU SMP Service Client
###########################

This module implements a Simple Management Protocol (SMP) Service Client that can be used in the context of Device Firmware Updates (DFU).
SMP is a basic transfer encoding for use with the `MCUmgr`_ management protocol.
See `SMP over Bluetooth`_ for the service specification.

The SMP Client module can be used to interact with Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:smp_svr_sample`.

The SMP Client implements only the service.
It does not provide any functionality to process or interpret SMP commands and responses.

The SMP Service Client is used in the :ref:`bluetooth_central_dfu_smp` sample.

Service UUID
************

The 128-bit service UUID is 8D53DC1D-1DB7-4CD3-868B-8A527460AA84 (16-bit offset: 0x0001).

Characteristics
***************

This service has one characteristic that is used for both requests and responses.

SMP Characteristic (DA2E7828-FBCE-4E01-AE9E-261174997C48)
=========================================================

Write Without Response
   * Write an SMP command with data.

Notify
   * Response to the SMP command is sent using notification.
   * Multiple notifications may be generated if the response does not fit in a single MTU.

Usage
*****

.. note::
   Do not access any of the values in the :c:struct:`bt_gatt_dfu_smp_c` object structure directly.
   All values that should be accessed have accessor functions.
   The reason that the structure is fully defined is to allow the application to allocate the memory for it.

MTU negotiation
===============

The current DFU SMP Server implementation in the :ref:`zephyr:smp_svr_sample` requires the whole command to be sent in one transfer.
For most operations, this requires a bigger MTU size than the default one.
This requires MTU negotiation in the MTU exchange process (see :c:func:`bt_gatt_exchange_mtu`).
Writing long characteristic values is not supported.

Note that this is a limitation of the :ref:`zephyr:smp_svr_sample`, not of the SMP Client.

Sending a command
=================

To send a command, use :c:func:`bt_gatt_dfu_smp_c_command`.
The command is provided as a raw binary buffer consisting of a :c:struct:`dfu_smp_header` and the payload.


Processing the response
=======================

The response to a command is sent as notification.
It is passed to the callback function that was provided when issuing the command with :c:func:`bt_gatt_dfu_smp_c_command`.

Use :c:func:`bt_gatt_dfu_smp_c_rsp_state` to access the data of the current part of the response.
As the response might be received in multiple notifications, use :c:func:`bt_gatt_dfu_smp_c_rsp_total_check` to verify if this is the last part of the response.
The offset size of the current part and the total size are available in fields of the :c:struct:`bt_gatt_dfu_smp_rsp_state` structure.
