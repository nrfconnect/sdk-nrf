 * @brief BT Scanning module
 *
 * @details The Scanning Module handles the Bluetooth LE scanning for
 *          your application. The module offers several criteria
 *          for filtering the devices available for connection,
 *          and it can also work in the simple mode without using the filtering.
 *          If an event handler is provided, your main application can react to
 *          a filter match. The module can also be configured to automatically
 *          connect after it matches a filter.
 *
 * @note The Scanning Module also supports applications with a
 *       multicentral link.
