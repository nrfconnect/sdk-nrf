Hardware flash write protection
###############################

The hardware flash write protection driver (``fprotect``) can be used to protect flash areas from writing.
The driver uses a hardware peripheral (BPROT, ACL, or SPU, depending on the chip model) to protect the area.
The protection is irreversible until a reset occurs.

The following example shows how to protect ``PM_B0_SIZE`` bytes of the flash area starting from ``PM_B0_ADDRESS``:

.. code-block:: c

   int err = fprotect_area(PM_B0_ADDRESS, PM_B0_SIZE);
