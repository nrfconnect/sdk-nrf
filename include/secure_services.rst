Secure Services
###############

Secure Services are functions implemented in the Secure Firmware (:ref:`secure_partition_manager`), but made available to be called from the Non-Secure Firmware.

Calling functions in this API requires that the service is enabled in the :ref:`secure_partition_manager`.
See :option:`CONFIG_SPM_SECURE_SERVICES` in the :ref:`secure_partition_manager`'s menuconfig.
Some services are enabled by default.

.. Remove parts with regards to debugging and flashing when NRF91-313 is resolved

By default :option:`CONFIG_SPM_BLOCK_NON_SECURE_RESET` is disabled. This is to make sure that your debugger will be able to issue a system reset during the development stage and that devices which do not have pin-reset routed can do a re-flashing routine correctly. This option should be turned off when you are putting a product into production to increase the security of your device.
