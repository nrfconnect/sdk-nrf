/** @brief Initialize MPSL and attach interrupt handlers.

 * This routine initializes MPSL (via `mpsl_init`) after

 * all required interrupt handlers.
 *
 * @pre This method requires CONFIG_MPSL_DYNAMIC_INTERRUPTS to be enabled and
 *      MPSL to have been previously uninitialized via @ref mpsl_lib_uninit.
 *
 * @note
 * After successful execution of this method, any existing interrupt handlers
 * will be detached from RADIO_IRQn, RTC0_IRQn, and TIMER0_IRQn.
 *
 * @retval   0             MPSL enabled successfully.
 * @retval   -NRF_EPERM    Operation is not supported or
 *                         MPSL is already initialized.

/** @brief Uninitialize MPSL and disable interrupt handlers.
 *
 * This routine uninitializes MPSL (via `mpsl_uninit`) and
 * disables MPSL interrupts. Uninitializing MPSL stops clocks and scheduler.
 * This will release all peripherals and reduce power usage, allowing the
 * user to override any interrupt handlers used by MPSL.
 *
 * @pre This method requires CONFIG_MPSL_DYNAMIC_INTERRUPTS to be enabled.
 * @pre The function requires the multithreading lock (@see MULTITHREADING_LOCK_ACQUIRE())
 *      to be acquired before.
 *
 * @note
 * After successful execution of this method, user-supplied interrupt
 * handlers can be attached to RADIO_IRQn, RTC0_IRQn, and TIMER0_IRQn
 * using `irq_connect_dynamic`.
 * Care must be taken when developing these handlers, as they will be
 * executed as direct dynamic interrupts.
 * See `ARM_IRQ_DIRECT_DYNAMIC_CONNECT` for additional documentation.
 * These interrupts will trigger thread re-scheduling upon return.
 *
 * @retval   0             MPSL disabled successfully.
 * @retval   -NRF_EPERM    Operation is not supported.
