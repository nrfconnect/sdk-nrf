/**
 * @defgroup dfu_multi_image DFU Multi Image
 * @brief Provides an API for writing DFU Multi Image package
 *
 * DFU Multi Image package is a general-purpose update file consisting of a CBOR-based
 * header that describes contents of the package, followed by a number of update
 * components, such as firmware images for different MCU cores. More specifically, the
 * header contains signed numeric identifiers and sizes of included images. The meaning
 * of the identifiers is application-specific, that is, a user is allowed to assign
 * arbitrary identifiers to their images.
 *
 * A DFU Multi Image package can be built manually using either the Python script
 * located at 'scripts/bootloader/dfu_multi_image_tool.py' or the CMake wrapper defined
 * in 'cmake/dfu_multi_image.cmake'. Additionally, @c DFU_MULTI_IMAGE_PACKAGE_BUILD and
 * related Kconfig options are available to enable building of a package that includes
 * common update images.
 *
 * The DFU Multi Image library can be used to process a DFU Multi Image package downloaded
 * onto a device during the DFU process. Its proper usage consists of the following steps:
 *
 * 1. Call @c dfu_multi_image_init function to initialize the library's context.
 * 2. Call @c dfu_multi_image_register_writer for each image identifier you would like to
 *    extract from the package. Images included in the package for which no corresponding
 *    writers have been registered will be ignored.
 * 3. Pass subsequent downloaded chunks of the package to @c dfu_multi_image_write
 *    function. The chunks must be provided in order. Note that if the function returns
 *    an error, no more chunks shall be provided.
 * 4. Call @c dfu_multi_image_done function to release open resources and verify that all
 *    data declared in the header have been written properly.
