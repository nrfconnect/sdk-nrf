menuconfig RAM_POWER_DOWN_LIBRARY
	bool "Enable API for turning off unused RAM segments"
	help
	  This allows application to call API for disabling unused RAM segments
	  in the System ON mode. Effectively the application looses possibility
	  to use disabled portion of RAM.
	  This is usually not needed, but can improve battery lifetime for
	  applications that spend most of the time in the sleep mode with most
	  peripherals disabled.
