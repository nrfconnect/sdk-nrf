	  This allows application to call API for disabling unused RAM segments
	  in the System ON mode. Effectively the application looses possibility
	  to use disabled portion of RAM.
	  This is usually not needed, but can improve battery lifetime for
	  applications that spend most of the time in the sleep mode with most
	  peripherals disabled.

	  When this option is enabled, the RAM sections not used by the application
	  image will get automatically disabled at boot time, and then RAM power
	  configuration will be adjusted when the libc heap (which uses the memory
	  area following the application image) is increased or trimmed.
