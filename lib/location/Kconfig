	  Sets the time (in milliseconds) since GNSS start after which the obstructed visibility
	  detection is performed. The default value is a good starting point when A-GPS is used.
	  Without assistance, the value should probably be adjusted, because GNSS acquires
	  satellites more slowly.

	help
	  Sets the minimum number of satellites which must have been acquired by GNSS when the
	  obstructed visibility detection is performed. If less satellites have been acquired,
	  GNSS is stopped immediately to save energy. The default value is a good starting point
	  when A-GPS is used. Without assistance, the value should probably be adjusted, because
	  GNSS acquires satellites more slowly.
