	bool "Initialize during SYS_INIT"
	default y
	help
	  Initialize BSD library automatically during the SYS_INIT sequence.
	  Please note that BSD library initialization is synchronous and can
	  take up to one minute in case the modem firmware is updated.

config NRF91_SOCKET_SEND_SPLIT_LARGE_BLOCKS
	bool "Split large blocks passed to send() or sendto()"
	default n
	help
	  Workaround a limitation in the nRF91 modem firmware's bsdlib
	  implementation regarding return value for send() or sendto()
	  calls larger than the module can handle. It should send the data
	  up to the maximum, and return that as the return value. Instead,
	  it returns error 22.

config NRF91_SOCKET_BLOCK_LIMIT
	int "Maximum size the modem can send"
	default 2048
	help
	  Blocks larger than this value will be split into two or more
	  send() or sendto() calls. This may not work for certain kinds
	  of sockets or certain flag parameter values.

config BSD_LIBRARY_SENDMSG_BUF_SIZE
	int "Size of the sendmsg intermediate buffer"
	default 128
	help
	  Size of an intermediate buffer used by `sendmsg` to repack data and
	  therefore limit the number of `sendto` calls. The buffer is created
	  in a static memory, so it does not impact stack/heap usage. In case
	  the repacked message would not fit into the buffer, `sendmsg` sends
	  each message part separately.
