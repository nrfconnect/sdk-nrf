	  Enable the software library FPROTECT that may or may not be used
	  by other systems to protect flash from writes and possibly also
	  reads. Does not protect against execution.
	  May use the HW peripherals BPROT, ACL, or SPU to achieve this.

config FPROTECT_APP
	bool "Lock image partition using FPROTECT"
	help
	  The flash partition which contains the image hex file should never be
	  written to. Set this option to enable a module which will perform
	  a 'fprotect_area' operation during system initialization before
	  the kernel is initialized. This will ensure that the appropriate
	  locking mechanism is configured to not allow write operations to the
	  memory partition which contains the image hex file. Note that this
	  imposes a requirement to the start address and size of the image
	  hex file: they must both be aligned with the locking granularity
	  of the locking mechanism available for the current hardware. See
	  'FPROTECT_BLOCK_SIZE' and set the partition sizes in the system so
	  that this is aligned with the 'app' partition. The start and size
	  of the 'app' partition can be found by either inspecting the file
	  'pm_config.h' in your build directory, or by invoking the
	  'partition_manager_report' target.

config FPROTECT_ALLOW_COMBINED_REGIONS
	bool "Use both RRAMC_regions"

	  Intended for use with NRF54L series devices. Gives total of 62kB
