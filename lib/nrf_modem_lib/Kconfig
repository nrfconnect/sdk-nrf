	help
	  Initialize the Modem library automatically during the SYS_INIT sequence.
	  Please note that initialization is synchronous and can take up to one
	  minute in case the modem firmware is updated.

	bool "Split large blocks passed to send() or sendto()"
	default n
	help
	  Workaround a limitation in the Modem library regarding the return
	  value for send() or sendto() calls larger than the module can handle.
	  It should send the data up to the maximum, and return that as the return value.
	  Instead, it returns error 22.

config NRF91_SOCKET_BLOCK_LIMIT
	int "Maximum size the modem can send"
	default 2048
	help
	  Blocks larger than this value will be split into two or more
	  send() or sendto() calls. This may not work for certain kinds
	  of sockets or certain flag parameter values.

config NRF_MODEM_LIB_SENDMSG_BUF_SIZE
	int "Size of the sendmsg intermediate buffer"
	default 128
	help
	  Size of an intermediate buffer used by `sendmsg` to repack data and
	  therefore limit the number of `sendto` calls. The buffer is created
	  in a static memory, so it does not impact stack/heap usage. In case
	  the repacked message would not fit into the buffer, `sendmsg` sends
	  each message part separately.
