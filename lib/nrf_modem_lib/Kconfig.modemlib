	  Initialize the Modem library automatically during the SYS_INIT sequence.

	  minute in case the modem firmware is updated.

config NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE_ENABLED

	help
	  When this is enabled, the modem lib will allocate space for modem traces in the shared
	  memory. When this is done, the modem will start sending all proprietary trace data to
	  the application as soon as it is initialized. To stop these traces or to activate a
	  smaller subset of traces, the AT command %XMODEMTRACE can be used. The modem_trace API
	  may also be used for this purpose.
	  The default size of the Trace region is defined by the
	  NRF_MODEM_LIB_SHMEM_TRACE_SIZE option.

	  needs to be allocated on the heap for each trace buffer. The trace heap size and trace thread
	  priority might need to be adjusted depending on the application needs.

	  each message part separately.
