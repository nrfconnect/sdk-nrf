	  To request A-GPS data from nRF Cloud via MQTT, CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_MQTT
	  must be enabled and the connection must already be established.
	  When a request for A-GPS data is sent to nRF Cloud, the response will
	  be received on the same socket as all other nRF Cloud communication,
	  and the data will have to be processed further in the application.
	  A-GPS data can also be requested from nRF Cloud via REST.
