Every released version of the LwM2M carrier library is considered for certification with applicable carriers.
The LwM2M carrier library is certified together with specific versions of the modem firmware and the |NCS|.

For a list of all the carrier certifications (including those certifications with no dependency on the LwM2M carrier library), see the `Mobile network operator certifications`_.

.. note::

   Your final product will need certification from the carrier.
   Please contact the carrier for more information on their respective device certification program.
   If your carrier is AT&T or Verizon Wireless, see `AT&T's Get network ready program`_, and `Verizon's Get certified program`_ for more information.
