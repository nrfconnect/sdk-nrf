 *  @details This timer is set to verify whether a tag response is received

 *           end of the ST25R3911B transmission. According to NFC Forum
 *           Digital 2.0 6.10.1.
 *
 *  @param[in] fc         Wait time defined in 64/fc or 4096/fc unit.
 *  @param[in] long_range Long range mode. If this parameter is set, one
 *                        FDT time is fc * 4096, otherwise fc * 64.
 *  @param[in] emv        Emv mode. If set, the timer unconditionally
 *                        produces an IRQ when it expires and is not
 *                        stopped by a direct command Clear. This means that
 *                        IRQ is independent of whether a tag reply was
 *                        detected. If a tag reply is being processed at the
 *                        moment of time-out, no other action is taken. If no
 *                        tag response is being processed, the signal rx_on
 *                        is forced to low to stop the receive process.
 *                        If emv mode is not set, the
 *                        IRQ is produced if the No-Response timer expires
 *                        before a start of a tag reply is detected, and rx_on
 *                        is forced to low to stop the receiver process. If
 *                        the start of a tag reply is detected
 *                        before time-out, the timer is stopped, and no IRQ is
 *                        produced.
