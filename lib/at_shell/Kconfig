	  Adds the AT command capability to shell. The shell command is called
	  "at" and will interpret arguments as AT commands, and print back the
	  response from the modem.

	  Replaces \n with <CR><LF>. This enables commands such as AT%CMNG=0 to
	  properly receive certificates that ordinarily have multiple lines.
	  The certificate must have been preprocessed to replace EOL sequences
	  with a literal \ character followed by an n character.
