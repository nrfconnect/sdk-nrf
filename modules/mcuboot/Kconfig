	  Absolute path to PEM key file containing the private key corresponding
	  to the public key included in MCUBoot. This will be used to sign the
	  image so that it can be verified by MCUBoot. Since MCUBoot is not
	  built from source, it is not possible for the build system to deduce
	  what key was used when compiling it. Hence, it is required that the
	  key is passed to the build system through this option.
