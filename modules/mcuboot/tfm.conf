# Don't configure the MPU in the bootloader. Configuring the MPU from

# The MCUBoot max size is usually 48kb, but is reduced to 32kb with
# this option. TF-M is placed after MCUBoot and it's end must be
# aligned to 32kb due to placement requirements of the veneers. A
# result of these requirements is that TF-M will consume an excessive
# amount of flash if it is placed after a 48kb MCUBoot, so we default
# to allocating 32kb to MCUBoot instead.
