config HTTP_SERVER_SAMPLE_PEER_VERIFICATION_REQUIRE
	bool "Peer verification"
	help
	  Enable this option to make the server sample require TLS peer verification.
	  Enabling peer verification ensures that the server validates the authenticity
	  of the client during TLS/SSL handshake. This helps enhance the security of
	  communications by verifying the identity of the connecting peer.

config HTTP_SERVER_SAMPLE_PORT
	int "Server Port"
	default 443 if NET_SOCKETS_SOCKOPT_TLS
	default 80

config HTTP_SERVER_SAMPLE_CLIENTS_MAX
	int "Maximum clients"
	default 2
	help
	  This option sets the maximum number of concurrent clients.
	  Increasing this option will impact the performance of the server and increase the
	  total memory footprint as each client instance has its own thread with a dedicated stack.
	  This option sets the number of maximum concurrecnt clients per IP family, meaning that
	  if both IPv4 and IPv6 is enabled, a total of 4 clients can be connected at the same time.

config HTTP_SERVER_SAMPLE_SERVER_CERTIFICATE_SEC_TAG
	int "Server Certificate Security Tag"
	default 1
	help
	  This option sets the security tag for the credentials used in TLS.

config HTTP_SERVER_SAMPLE_STACK_SIZE
	int "Thread Stack Size"
	default 4096
	help
	  This option sets the stack size for the threads used in the sample.

config HTTP_SERVER_SAMPLE_RECEIVE_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Receive Buffer Size"
	default 1024
	help
	  This option sets the receive buffer size for the sockets used in the sample.
