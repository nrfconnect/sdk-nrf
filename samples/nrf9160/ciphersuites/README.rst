nRF9160: TLS cipher suites
##########################

   :depth: 2

The Transport Layer Security (TLS) cipher suites sample demonstrates a minimal implementation of a client application that attempts to connect to a host by trying different TLS cipher suites.
This sample shows the cipher suites and lists them as supported or not supported by the host, and provides a summary of the support.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kit:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

Overview
********

The sample first initializes the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem` and AT communications.
Next, it provisions a root CA certificate to the modem using the :ref:`modem_key_mgmt` library.
Provisioning must be done before connecting to the LTE network because the certificates can only be provisioned when the device is not connected.

The sample then iterates through a list of TLS cipher suites, attempting connection to the host with each one of them.
The sample connects successfully to the host (``www.example.com``) with the cipher suites that are supported by the host, while unsupported cipher suites cause a connection failure, setting ``errno`` to ``95``.

Finally, the sample provides a summary of the cipher suites that are supported and not supported by the host, ``example.com``.

Obtaining a certificate
=======================

The sample connects to ``www.example.com``, which requires an X.509 certificate.
This certificate is provided in the :file:`samples/nrf9160/https_client/cert` folder.

To connect to other servers, you might need to provision a different certificate.
See :ref:`cert_dwload` for more information.

Configuration
**************

|config|

Configuration options
=====================

Check and configure the following Kconfig options:

.. _CONFIG_EXTENDED_CIPHERSUITE_LIST:

CONFIG_EXTENDED_CIPHERSUITE_LIST
   The sample configuration extends the cipher suite list with extra cipher suites that are only supported by modem firmware v1.3.x, where x is greater than or equal to 1 and modem firmware v1.2.x, where x is greater than or equal to 7.

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/nrf9160/ciphersuites`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

Testing
=======

|test_sample|

1. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal|
#. Observe that the sample starts, provisions certificates, and connects to the LTE network.
#. Observe that the sample iterates through a list of cipher suites, attempting a connection to ``example.com`` with each one of them, showing either a successful or an unsuccessful connection.

Sample output
=============

The sample shows the following output:
