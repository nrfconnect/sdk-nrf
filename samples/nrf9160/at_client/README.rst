nRF9160: AT Client
##################

The AT Client sample demonstrates the asynchronous serial communication taking place over UART to the nRF9160 modem.
The sample enables you to use an external computer or MCU to send AT commands to the LTE-M/NB-IoT modem of your nRF9160 device.

Overview
********

The AT Client sample acts as a proxy for sending directives to the nRF9160 modem via AT commands.
This facilitates the reading of responses or analyzing of events related to the nRF9160 modem.
The commands can be initiated from a terminal or the `LTE Link Monitor`_, which is an application implemented as part of `nRF Connect for Desktop`_.

For more information on the AT commands, see the `AT Commands Reference Guide`_.



Requirements
************

* The following development board:

  * nRF9160 DK board (PCA10090)


Building and running
********************

Connecting to the nRF9160 DK board with LTE Link Monitor
========================================================

To connect to the nRF9160 DK board with LTE Link Monitor, perform the following steps:

#. Launch the LTE Link Monitor after programming the AT Client sample onto the nRF9160 DK board.
#. Make sure that **Automatic requests** is enabled in LTE Link Monitor.
#. Connect the nRF9160 DK board to the PC with a USB cable.
#. Power on the nRF9160 DK board.
#. Click **Select Device** and select the particular board device entry from the drop-down list in the LTE Link Monitor.
#. Observe that initially the command :command:`AT+CFUN?` is automatically sent to the modem, which returns a value 4, indicating that the modem is in the offline mode.
#. Observe that the LTE Link Monitor terminal display also shows :command:`AT+CFUN=1` indicating that the modem has changed to the normal mode.
#. Press the reset button on the nRF9160 DK to reboot the board and start the AT Client sample.


Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your board, test the sample by performing the following steps:

1. `Connect to the nRF9160 DK board with LTE Link Monitor <Connecting to the nRF9160 DK board with LTE Link Monitor_>`_.
#. Run the following commands from the LTE Link Monitor terminal:

   a. Enter the command: :command:`AT+CFUN?`

      This command reads the current functional mode of the modem and triggers the command :command:`AT+CFUN=1` which sets the functional mode of the modem to normal.

   #. Enter the command :command:`AT+CFUN?` into the LTE Link Monitor terminal again.

      The UART/Modem/UICC/LTE/PDN indicators in the LTE Link Monitor side panel turn green.
      This command also automatically launches a series of commands like:

     * :command:`AT+CGSN=1` which displays the product serial identification number (IMEI).
     * :command:`AT+CGMI`   which displays the manufacturer name.
     * :command:`AT+CGMM`   which displays the model identification name.
     * :command:`AT+CGMR`   which displays the revision identification.
     * :command:`AT+CEMODE` which displays the current mode of operation.

   c. Enter the command: :command:`AT%XOPERID`

      This command returns the network operator ID.


   #. Enter the command: :command:`AT%XMONITOR`

      This command returns the modem parameters.


   #. Enter the command: :command:`AT%XTEMP?`

      This command displays the current modem temperature.


   #. Enter the command: :command:`AT%CMNG=1`

      This command displays a list of all certificates that are stored on your device.
      If the device has been added to nRF Cloud, a CA certificate, a client certificate, and a private key with security tag 16842753 (which is the security tag for nRF Cloud credentials) are displayed.



Sample output
=============

The following is a sample output of the command: :command:`AT%XMONITOR`

.. code-block:: console

   AT%XMONITOR
   %XMONITOR: 5,"","","24201","76C1",7,20,"0102DA03",105,6400,53,24,"","11100000","11100000"
   OK
