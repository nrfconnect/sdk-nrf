The Location sample demonstrates how you can retrieve the location of a device using GNSS, cellular or Wi-Fi positioning method.
This sample uses the :ref:`lib_location` library.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

See also the requirements in :ref:`lib_location` library document.

.. note::
   .. include:: /includes/nrf_cloud_rest_sample_requirements.txt

Overview
********

The Location sample retrieves the location multiple times to illustrate the different ways of retrieving the location of a device.
Each individual location request has been implemented in a separate function within the sample.
In addition to the :ref:`lib_location` library, this sample uses :ref:`lte_lc_readme` to control the LTE connection.

Configuration
*************

|config|

Additional configuration
========================

Refer to the :ref:`lib_location` library document for configuring the location retrieval behavior, including supported location methods and services.

If you use an external GNSS antenna, add the following configuration:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MODEM_ANTENNA_GNSS_EXTERNAL` - Selects an external GNSS antenna.

Configuration files
===================

The sample provides predefined configuration files for typical use cases.
The configuration files are in the |sample path| directory.

The following files are available:

* :file:`nrf9160dk_with_nrf7002ek.overlay` - DTC overlay for nRF7002 EK Wi-Fi chip support.
* :file:`nrf7002ek-wifi-scan-only.conf` - Config overlay for nRF7002 EK Wi-Fi chip support.
* :file:`esp_8266_nrf9160ns.overlay` - DTC overlay for ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip support.
* :file:`overlay-esp-wifi.conf` - Config overlay for ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip support.
* :file:`overlay-pgps.conf` - Config overlay for P-GPS support.

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/nrf9160/location`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

nRF9160 DK with nRF7002 EK Wi-Fi support
========================================

To build the sample with nRF9160 DK and nRF7002 EK Wi-Fi support, use the ``-DSHIELD=nrf7002_ek``, ``-DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=nrf9160dk_with_nrf7002ek.overlay`` and  ``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-nrf7002ek-wifi-scan-only.conf`` options.

For example:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -p -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160ns -- -DSHIELD=nrf7002_ek -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=nrf9160dk_with_nrf7002ek.overlay -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-nrf7002ek-wifi-scan-only.conf

See :ref:`cmake_options` for more instructions on how to add these options.

ESP8266 Wi-Fi support
=====================

To build the Location sample with ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip support, use the ``-DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=esp_8266_nrf9160ns.overlay`` and  ``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-esp-wifi.conf`` options.

For example:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -p -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns -- -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=esp_8266_nrf9160ns.overlay -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-esp-wifi.conf

See :ref:`cmake_options` for more instructions on how to add these options.

P-GPS support
=============

To build the Location sample with P-GPS support, use the ``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-pgps.conf`` option.
For example:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -p -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns -- -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-pgps.conf

See :ref:`cmake_options` for more instructions on how to add this option.

Testing
