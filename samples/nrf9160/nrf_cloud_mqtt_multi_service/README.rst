This sample is a minimal, error tolerant, integrated demonstration of the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud`, :ref:`lib_location`, and :ref:`lib_at_host` libraries.
It demonstrates how you can use these libraries together to support Firmware-Over-The-Air (FOTA), Location Services, periodic sensor samples, and more in your `nRF Cloud`_-enabled application.
It also demonstrates how to implement error tolerance in your cellular applications without relying on reboot loops.

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_features:

Features
********

This sample implements or demonstrates the following features:

* Error-tolerant use of the `nRF Cloud MQTT API`_ using the :ref:`nrf_modem` and :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library.
* Support for `Firmware-Over-The-Air (FOTA) update service <nRF Cloud Getting Started FOTA documentation_>`_ using the `nRF Cloud`_ portal.
* Support for `modem AT commands <AT Commands Reference Guide_>`_ over UART using the :ref:`lib_at_host` library.
* Support for remote execution of modem AT commands using application-specific device messages.
* Periodic cellular, Wi-Fi, and GNSS location tracking using the :ref:`lib_location` library.
* Periodic temperature sensor sampling on your `Nordic Thingy:91`_, or fake temperature  measurements on your `Nordic nRF9160 DK`_.
* Transmission of sensor and GNSS location samples to the nRF Cloud portal as `nRF Cloud device messages <nRF Cloud Device Messages_>`_.
* Construction of valid `nRF Cloud device messages <nRF Cloud Device Messages_>`_ using `cJSON`_.
* Minimal LED status indication using the `Zephyr LED API`_.

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_structure_and_theory_of_operation:

Structure and theory of operation
*********************************

This sample is separated into a number of smaller functional units.
The top level functional unit and entry point for the sample is the :file:`src/main.c` file.
This file starts three primary threads, each with a distinct function:

* The connection thread (``con_thread``) runs the :ref:`nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_connection_management_loop`, which maintains a connection to `nRF Cloud`_.
* The application thread (``app_thread``) Runs the :ref:`nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_application_thread_and_main_application_loop`, which may add `device messages <nRF Cloud Device Messages_>`_ to the :ref:`nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_device_message_queue`.
* The message thread (``msg_thread``) processes the :ref:`nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_device_message_queue` whenever there is an active connection.

:file:`src/main.c` also optionally starts a fourth thread, the ``led_thread``, which animates any onboard LEDs if :ref:`nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_led_status_indication` is enabled.

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_connection_management_loop:

Connection management loop
==========================

The connection management loop performs the following four primary tasks:

1) Configures and activates the cellular modem.
#) Starts a connection to the LTE network.
#) Maintains a connection to `nRF Cloud`_.
#) Re-establishes or retries all lost or failed connections.

The modem only needs to be set up and connected to LTE once.
If LTE is lost, the modem automatically works to re-establish it.

The connection to nRF Cloud must be maintained manually by the application.
A significant portion of the :file:`src/connection.c` file is dedicated to this task.

This file also maintains a number of `Zephyr Events`_ tracking the state of the LTE and nRF Cloud connections.
The connection management loop relies on these events to control its progression.

The connection management loop must conform to the :ref:`nRF Cloud connection process <lib_nrf_cloud_connect>`.
This is mostly handled by the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library, with exception to the following behavior:
When a device is first being associated with an nRF Cloud account, the `nRF Cloud MQTT API`_ will send a user association request notification to the device.
Upon receiving this notification, the device must wait for a user association success notification, and then manually disconnect from and reconnect to nRF Cloud.
Notifications of user association success are sent for every subsequent connection after this as well, so the device must only disconnect and reconnect if it previously received a user association request notification.
This behavior is handled by the ``NRF_CLOUD_EVT_USER_ASSOCIATION_REQUEST`` and ``NRF_CLOUD_EVT_USER_ASSOCIATED`` cases inside the :c:func:`cloud_event_handler` function in the :file:`src/connection.c` file.

The application must also manually reset its connection to nRF Cloud whenever LTE is lost.
Otherwise, the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library will deadlock.
The ``LTE_LC_EVT_NW_REG_STATUS`` case inside the :c:func:`lte_event_handler` function performs this task.

Upon startup, the connection management loop also updates the `Device Shadow <nRF Cloud Device Shadows_>`_.
This is performed in the :c:func:`update_shadow` function of the :file:`src/connection.c` file.

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_device_message_queue:

Device message queue
====================

Any thread may submit `device messages <nRF Cloud Device Messages_>`_ to the device message queue, where they are stored until a working connection to `nRF Cloud`_ is established.
Once this happens, the message thread transmits all enqueued device messages, one at a time and in fast succession, to nRF Cloud.
If an enqueued message fails to send, it will be sent back to the queue and tried again later.
If more than :ref:`CONFIG_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SEND_FAILURES <CONFIG_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SEND_FAILURES>` messages fail to send in a row, the connection to nRF Cloud is reset and re-established after a short delay.
The transmission pauses again whenever connection to nRF Cloud is lost.
Management of the device message queue is implemented entirely in the :file:`src/connection.c` file.

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_application_thread_and_main_application_loop:

Application thread and main application loop
============================================

The application thread is implemented in the :file:`src/application.c` file, and is responsible for the high-level behavior of this sample.
It performs the following major tasks:

* Establishes periodic position tracking (which the :ref:`lib_location` library performs).
* Periodically samples temperature data (using the :file:`src/temperature.c` file).
* Constructs timestamped sensor sample and location `device messages <nRF Cloud Device Messages_>`_ using `cJSON`_.
* Sends sensor sample and location device messages to the :ref:`nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_device_message_queue`.
* Checks for and executes :ref:`remote modem AT command requests <nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_remote_at>`.

.. note::
   Periodic location tracking is handled by the :ref:`lib_location` library once it has been requested, whereas temperature samples are individually requested by the Main Application Loop.

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_fota:

FOTA
====

The `FOTA update <nRF Cloud Getting Started FOTA Documentation_>`_ support is almost entirely implemented by enabling the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_FOTA` option (which is implicitly enabled by :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_MQTT`).

However, even with :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_FOTA` enabled, applications must still reboot themselves manually after FOTA download completion, and must still update their `Device Shadow <nRF Cloud Device Shadows_>`_ to reflect FOTA support.

Reboot after download completion is handled by the :file:`src/fota_support.c` file, triggered by a call from the :file:`src/connection.c` file.

`Device Shadow <nRF Cloud Device Shadows_>`_ updates are performed in the :file:`src/connection.c` file.

In a real-world setting, these two behaviors could be directly implemented in the :file:`src/connection.c` file.
In this sample, they are separated for clarity.

This sample supports full modem FOTA for the nRF9160 development kit version 0.14.0 and higher.
To enable full modem FOTA, add the following parameter to your build command:

``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay_full_modem_fota.conf``

Also, specify your development kit version by appending it to the board name. For example, if your development kit version is 1.0.1, use the following board name in your build command:

``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns@1_0_1``

This sample also supports placement of the MCUboot secondary partition in external flash for the nRF9160 development kit version 0.14.0 and higher.
To enable this, add the following parameter to your build command:

``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay_mcuboot_ext_flash.conf``

Then specify your development kit version as described earlier.

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_temperature_sensing:

Temperature sensing
===================

Temperature sensing is mostly implemented in the :file:`src/temperature.c` file.
This includes generation of false temperature readings on the `Nordic nRF9160 DK`_, which does not have a built-in temperature sensor.

Using the built-in temperature sensor of the `Nordic Thingy:91`_ requires a `devicetree overlay <Zephyr Devicetree Overlays_>`_ file, namely the :file:`boards/thingy91_nrf9160_ns.overlay` file, as well as enabling the Kconfig options :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SENSOR` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BME680`.
The devicetree overlay file is automatically applied during compilation whenever the ``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` target is selected.
The required Kconfig options are implicitly enabled by :ref:`CONFIG_TEMP_DATA_USE_SENSOR <CONFIG_TEMP_DATA_USE_SENSOR>`.

.. note::
  For temperature readings to be visible in the nRF Cloud portal, they must be marked as enabled in the `Device Shadow <nRF Cloud Device Shadows_>`_.
  This is performed by the :file:`src/connection.c` file.

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_location_tracking:

Location tracking
=================

All matters concerning location tracking are handled in the :file:`src/location_tracking.c` file.
This involves setting up a periodic location request, and then passing the results to a callback configured by the :file:`src/application.c` file.

For location readings to be visible in the nRF Cloud portal, they must be marked as enabled in the `Device Shadow <nRF Cloud Device Shadows_>`_.
This is performed by the :file:`src/connection.c` file.

Each enabled location method is tried in the following order until one succeeds: GNSS, Wi-Fi, then cellular.

The GNSS and cellular location tracking methods are enabled by default and will work on both Thingy:91 and nRF9160 DK targets.

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_wifi_location_tracking:

The Wi-Fi location tracking method is not enabled by default and requires the nRF7002 Wi-Fi companion chip.

When enabled, this location method scans the MAC addresses of nearby access points and submits them to nRF Cloud to obtain a location estimate.

See :ref:`nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_building_wifi` for details on how to enable Wi-Fi location tracking.

This sample supports placing P-GPS data in external flash for the nRF9160 development kit version 0.14.0 and later.
To enable this, add the following parameter to your build command:

``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay_pgps_ext_flash.conf``

Also, specify your development kit version by appending it to the board name.
For example, if your development kit version is 1.0.1, use the following board name in your build command:

``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns@1_0_1``

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_remote_at:

Remote execution of modem AT commands
=====================================

If the :ref:`CONFIG_AT_CMD_REQUESTS <CONFIG_AT_CMD_REQUESTS>` Kconfig option is enabled, you can remotely execute modem AT commands on your device by sending a device message with appId ``MODEM``, messageType ``CMD``, and the data key set to the command you would like to execute.

The application executes the command stored in the data key, and responds with a device message containing either an error code or the response from the modem to the AT command.

For example, if you send the following device message to a device running this sample with :ref:`CONFIG_AT_CMD_REQUESTS <CONFIG_AT_CMD_REQUESTS>` enabled:

.. code-block:: json

   {"appId":"MODEM", "messageType":"CMD", "data":"AT+CGMR"}

It executes the modem AT command ``AT+CGMR`` and sends a device message similar to the following back to nRF Cloud:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "appId": "MODEM",
      "messageType": "DATA",
      "ts": 1669244834095,
      "data": "mfw_nrf9160_1.3.2\r\nOK"
   }


To do this in the nRF Cloud portal, write `{"appId":"MODEM", "messageType":"CMD", "data":"AT+CGMR"}` into the **Send a message** box of the **Terminal** card and click :guilabel:`Send`.

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_led_status_indication:

LED status indication
=====================

On boards that support LED status indication, this sample can indicate its current status with any on-board LEDs.

This is performed by a background thread implemented in the :file:`src/led_control.c` file.

Other threads may request either a temporary or indefinite LED pattern.
This wakes up the ``led_thread``, which begins animating the requested pattern, sleeping for 100 milliseconds at a time between animation frames, until the requested pattern has completed (if it is temporary), or until a new pattern is requested in its place.

This feature is enabled by default for the ``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` (Thingy:91) and ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns`` (nRF9160 DK) targets.

The patterns displayed, the states they describe, and the options required for them to appear are as follows:

+------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Under all other circumstances, on-board LEDs are turned off.

.. note::
  The :ref:`CONFIG_LED_VERBOSE_INDICATION <CONFIG_LED_VERBOSE_INDICATION>` and :ref:`CONFIG_LED_CONTINUOUS_INDICATION <CONFIG_LED_CONTINUOUS_INDICATION>` options are enabled by default.

See :ref:`nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_customizing_LED_status_indication` for details on customizing the LED behavior.

See :ref:`nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_led_third_party` for details on configuring LED status indication on third-party boards.

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_test_counter:

Test counter
============

You can enable a test counter by enabling the :ref:`CONFIG_TEST_COUNTER <CONFIG_TEST_COUNTER>` option.
Every time a sensor sample is sent, this counter is incremented by one, and its current value is sent to `nRF Cloud`_.
A plot of the value of the counter over time is automatically shown in the nRF Cloud portal.
This plot is useful for tracking, visualizing, and debugging connection loss, resets, and re-establishment behavior.


.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_device_message_formatting:

Device message formatting
=========================

This sample constructs JSON-based `device messages <nRF Cloud Device Messages_>`_ using `cJSON`_.

While any valid JSON string can be sent as a device message, and accepted and stored by `nRF Cloud`_, there are some pre-designed message structures, known as schemas.
The nRF Cloud portal knows how to interpret these schemas.
These schemas are described in `nRF Cloud application protocols for long-range devices <nRF Cloud JSON protocol schemas_>`_.
The device messages constructed in the :file:`src/application.c` file all adhere to the general message schema.

GNSS and temperature data device messages conform to the ``gnss`` and ``temp`` ``deviceToCloud`` schemas respectively.

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_configuration:

Configuration
*************
|config|

Disabling key features
======================

The following key features of this sample may be independently disabled:

* GNSS-based location tracking - by setting the :ref:`CONFIG_LOCATION_TRACKING_GNSS <CONFIG_LOCATION_TRACKING_GNSS>` option to disabled.
* Cellular-based location tracking - by setting the :ref:`CONFIG_LOCATION_TRACKING_CELLULAR <CONFIG_LOCATION_TRACKING_CELLULAR>` option to disabled.
* Temperature tracking - by setting the :ref:`CONFIG_TEMP_TRACKING <CONFIG_TEMP_TRACKING>` option to disabled.
* GNSS assistance (A-GPS) - by setting the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_AGPS` option to disabled.
* Predictive GNSS assistance (P-GPS) - by setting the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_PGPS` option to disabled.

If you disable both GNSS and cellular-based location tracking, location tracking is completely disabled.

.. note::
  MQTT should only be used with applications that need to stay connected constantly or transfer data frequently.
  While this sample does allow its core features to be slowed or completely disabled, in real-world applications, you should carefully consider your data throughput and whether MQTT is an appropriate solution.
  If you want to disable or excessively slow all of these features for a real-world application, other solutions, such as the `nRF Cloud Rest API`_, may be more appropriate.

Customizing GNSS antenna configuration
======================================

This sample uses the :ref:`lib_modem_antenna` library, which is enabled by default for builds targeting either the ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns`` or ``thingy91_nrf9160_ns`` board names.

If you are using a different board or build target, or would like to use a custom or external GNSS antenna, see the :ref:`lib_modem_antenna` library documentation for configuration instructions.

Enable :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MODEM_ANTENNA_GNSS_EXTERNAL` to use an external antenna.

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_customizing_LED_status_indication:

Customizing LED status indication
=================================

To disable LED status indication (other than the selected idle behavior) after a connection to nRF Cloud has been established at least once, disable :ref:`CONFIG_LED_VERBOSE_INDICATION <CONFIG_LED_VERBOSE_INDICATION>`.

To turn the LED off while the sample is idle (rather than show an idle pattern), disable :ref:`CONFIG_LED_CONTINUOUS_INDICATION <CONFIG_LED_CONTINUOUS_INDICATION>`.

If you disable both of these options together, the status indicator LED remains off after a connection to nRF Cloud has been established at least once.

.. _nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_led_third_party:

Configuring LED status indication for third-party boards
========================================================

This sample assumes that the target board either has a single RGB LED with PWM support, or four discrete LEDs available.

For third-party boards, you can select the RGB LED option by enabling both the :ref:`CONFIG_LED_INDICATION_PWM <CONFIG_LED_INDICATION_PWM>` and :ref:`CONFIG_LED_INDICATION_RGB <CONFIG_LED_INDICATOR_RGB>` options.
In this case, the board must have a devicetree entry marked as compatible with the `Zephyr pwm-leds`_ driver.

Otherwise, the four-LED option (:ref:`CONFIG_LED_INDICATION_GPIO <CONFIG_LED_INDICATION_GPIO>` and :ref:`CONFIG_LED_INDICATOR_4LED <CONFIG_LED_INDICATOR_4LED>`) is selected by default as long as there is a devicetree entry compatible with the `Zephyr gpio-leds`_ driver.

The four-LED option should work even if there are not four LEDs available, as long as an appropriate devicetree entry exists.
However, if fewer than four LEDs are available, the patterns may be difficult to identify.

To add your own LED indication implementations, you can add values to the ``LED_INDICATOR`` Kconfig choice and modify the :file:`src/led_control.c` file accordingly.

To disable LED indication, enable the :ref:`CONFIG_LED_INDICATION_DISABLED <CONFIG_LED_INDICATION_DISABLED>` option.

For examples of how to set up devicetree entries compatible with the Zephyr ``gpio-leds`` and ``pwm-leds`` drivers, see the files :file:`zephyr/boards/arm/nrf9160dk_nrf9160/nrf9160dk_nrf9160_common.dts` and :file:`zephyr/boards/arm/thingy91_nrf9160/thingy91_nrf9160_common.dts`.
Search for nodes with ``compatible = "gpio-leds";`` and ``compatible = "pwm-leds";`` respectively.

Useful debugging options
========================

To see all debug output for this sample, enable the :ref:`CONFIG_MQTT_MULTI_SERVICE_LOG_LEVEL_DBG <CONFIG_MQTT_MULTI_SERVICE_LOG_LEVEL_DBG>` option.

To monitor the GNSS module (for instance, to see whether A-GPS or P-GPS assistance data is being consumed), enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_GPS_LOG_LEVEL_DBG` option.

See also the :ref:`nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_test_counter`.

Configuration options
=====================

Set the following configuration options for the sample:

.. _CONFIG_MQTT_MULTI_SERVICE_LOG_LEVEL_DBG:

CONFIG_MQTT_MULTI_SERVICE_LOG_LEVEL_DBG - Sample debug logging
   Sets the log level for this sample to debug.

.. _CONFIG_POWER_SAVING_MODE_ENABLE:

CONFIG_POWER_SAVING_MODE_ENABLE - Enable Power Saving Mode (PSM)
   Requests Power Saving Mode from cellular network when enabled.

.. _CONFIG_LTE_INIT_RETRY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS:

CONFIG_LTE_INIT_RETRY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS - LTE initialization retry timeout
   Sets the number of seconds between each LTE modem initialization retry.

.. _CONFIG_CLOUD_CONNECTION_RETRY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS:

CONFIG_CLOUD_CONNECTION_RETRY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS - Cloud connection retry timeout (seconds)
   Sets the cloud connection retry timeout in seconds.

.. _CONFIG_CLOUD_CONNECTION_REESTABLISH_DELAY_SECONDS:

CONFIG_CLOUD_CONNECTION_REESTABLISH_DELAY_SECONDS - Cloud connection re-establishment delay (seconds)
   Sets the connection re-establishment delay in seconds.
   When the connection to nRF Cloud has been reset, wait for this amount of time before a new attempt to connect.

.. _CONFIG_CLOUD_READY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS:

CONFIG_CLOUD_READY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS - Cloud readiness timeout (seconds)
   Sets the cloud readiness timeout in seconds.
   If the connection to nRF Cloud does not become ready within this timeout, the sample will reset its connection and try again.

.. _CONFIG_DATE_TIME_ESTABLISHMENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS:

CONFIG_DATE_TIME_ESTABLISHMENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS - Modem date and time establishment timeout (seconds)
   Sets the timeout for modem date and time establishment (in seconds).
   The sample waits for this number of seconds for the modem to determine the current date and time before giving up and moving on.

.. _CONFIG_APPLICATION_THREAD_STACK_SIZE:

CONFIG_APPLICATION_THREAD_STACK_SIZE - Application Thread Stack Size (bytes)
   Sets the stack size (in bytes) for the application thread of the sample.

.. _CONFIG_CONNECTION_THREAD_STACK_SIZE:

CONFIG_CONNECTION_THREAD_STACK_SIZE - Connection Thread Stack Size (bytes)
   Sets the stack size (in bytes) for the connection thread of the sample.

.. _CONFIG_MESSAGE_THREAD_STACK_SIZE:

CONFIG_MESSAGE_THREAD_STACK_SIZE - Message Queue Thread Stack Size (bytes)
   Sets the stack size (in bytes) for the message queue processing thread of the sample.

.. _CONFIG_MAX_OUTGOING_MESSAGES:

CONFIG_MAX_OUTGOING_MESSAGES - Outgoing message maximum
   Sets the maximum number of messages that can be in the outgoing message queue.
   Messages submitted past this limit will not be enqueued.

.. _CONFIG_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SEND_FAILURES:

CONFIG_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SEND_FAILURES - Max outgoing consecutive send failures
   Sets the maximum number of device messages which may fail to send before a connection reset and cooldown is triggered.

.. _CONFIG_CONSECUTIVE_SEND_FAILURE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS:

CONFIG_CONSECUTIVE_SEND_FAILURE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS - Cooldown after max consecutive send failures exceeded (seconds)
   Sets the cooldown time (in seconds) after the maximum number of consecutive send failures is exceeded.
   If a connection reset is triggered by too many failed device messages, the sample waits for this long (in seconds) before trying again.

.. _CONFIG_SENSOR_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_SECONDS:

CONFIG_SENSOR_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_SECONDS - Sensor sampling interval (seconds)
   Sets the time to wait between each temperature sensor sample.

.. note::
   Decreasing the sensor sampling interval too much leads to more frequent use of the LTE connection, which can prevent GNSS from obtaining a fix.
   This is because GNSS can operate only when the LTE connection is not active.
   Every time a sensor sample is sent, it interrupts any attempted GNSS fix.
   The exact time required to obtain a GNSS fix will vary depending on satellite visibility, time since last fix, the type of antenna used, and other environmental factors.
   In good conditions, and with A-GPS data, one minute is a reasonable interval for reliably getting a location estimate.
   This allows using long enough value for :ref:`CONFIG_GNSS_FIX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS <CONFIG_GNSS_FIX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS>`, while still leaving enough time for falling back to cellular positioning if needed.

   The default sensor sampling interval, 60 seconds, will quickly consume cellular data, and should not be used in a production environment.
   Instead, consider using a less frequent interval, and if necessary, combining multiple sensor samples into a single `device message <nRF Cloud Device Messages_>`_ , or combining multiple device messages using the `d2c/bulk device message topic <nRF Cloud MQTT Topics_>`_.

   If you significantly increase the sampling interval, you must keep the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MQTT_KEEPALIVE` short to avoid the carrier silently closing the MQTT connection due to inactivity, which could result in dropped device messages.
   The exact maximum value depends on your carrier.
   In general, a few minutes or less should work well.

.. _CONFIG_GNSS_FIX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS:

CONFIG_GNSS_FIX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS - GNSS fix timeout (seconds)

Building with nRF7002 EK Wi-Fi scanning support (for nRF9160 DK)
================================================================

To build the sample with nRF7002 EK Wi-Fi scanning support, use the ``-DSHIELD=nrf7002_ek``, ``-DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=nrf9160dk_with_nrf7002ek.overlay`` and  ``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-nrf7002ek-wifi-scan-only.conf`` options.

This enables the Wi-Fi location tracking method automatically.

For example:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -p -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns -- -DSHIELD=nrf7002_ek -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE="nrf9160dk_with_nrf7002ek.overlay" -DOVERLAY_CONFIG="overlay-nrf7002ek-wifi-scan-only.conf"

This is only supported on the `Nordic nRF9160 DK`_ with an attached nRF7002 EK.

See also :ref:`the paragraphs on the Wi-Fi location tracking method <nrf_cloud_mqtt_multi_service_wifi_location_tracking>`.
