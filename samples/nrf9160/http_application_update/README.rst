nRF9160: HTTP application update
################################

The HTTP application update sample demonstrates how to do a basic FOTA (firmware over-the-air) update.
It uses the :ref:`lib_download_client` library to download a file from a remote server and write it to flash.


Overview
********

The sample connects to an HTTP server to download a signed firmware image.
The image is generated when building the sample, but you must upload it to a server and configure where it can be downloaded.
See `Specifying the image file`_ for more information.

By default, the image is saved to `MCUboot`_ bootloader secondary slot.
The downloaded image must be signed for use by MCUboot with imgtool.


Requirements
************

* The following development board:

  * nRF9160 DK board (PCA10090)

* A signed firmware image that is available for download from an HTTP server.
  This image is automatically generated when building the application.

* .. include:: /includes/spm.txt


Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/nrf9160/http_application_update`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt

The sample is built as a non-secure firmware image for the nrf9160_pca10090ns board.
Because of this, it automatically includes the :ref:`secure_partition_manager`.
The sample also uses MCUboot, which is automatically built and merged into the final HEX file when building the sample.


Specifying the image file
=========================

Before building the sample, you must specify where the image file will be located.
If you do not want to host it yourself, you can upload it to nRF Cloud for testing purposes.
See `Hosting your image on nRF Cloud`_ for instructions.

To specify the location in |SES|:

1. Select **Project** > **Configure nRF Connect SDK Project**.
#. Navigate to **HTTP application update sample** and specify the **Download host name** (``CONFIG_DOWNLOAD_HOST``) and **The file to download** (``CONFIG_DOWNLOAD_FILE``).
#. Click **Configure** to save the configuration.


Hosting your image on nRF Cloud
-------------------------------

1. Go to `firmware.nrfcloud.com`_ and sign in.
   If you already have an nRF Cloud account, you can use the same credentials.
   Otherwise, create an account and sign in.
#. In the menu on the left-hand side, select **Firmware**.
#. Click **Generate new** to create a URL for the firmware image.

   Generate URL for firmware image in nRF Cloud

#. Click the **Copy URL** button to copy the address.

When specifying the image file, use the ``s3.amazonaws.com`` part of the URL for the download host name.
Make sure to not include the ``https``.
Specify the rest of the URL as file name.


Testing
=======

After programming the sample to the board, test it by performing the following steps:

1. Configure the application version to be 2.
   To do so, either change ``CONFIG_APPLICATION_VERSION`` to 2 in the ``prj.conf`` file, or select **Project** > **Configure nRF Connect SDK Project** > **HTTP application update sample** in |SES| and change the value for **Application version**.
   Then rebuild the application.
#. Upload the file ``update.bin`` to the server you have chosen.
   To upload the file on nRF Cloud, click **Upload** for the firmware URL that you generated earlier.
   Then select the file ``update.bin`` and upload it.
#. Reset your nRF9160 DK to start the application.
#. Open a terminal emulator and observe that an output similar to this is printed::

    SPM: prepare to jump to Non-Secure image
    ***** Booting Zephyr OS v1.13.99 *****

#. Observe that LED1 is lit.
   This indicates that version 1 of the application is running.
#. Press Button 1 on the nRF9160 DK to start the download process and wait until "Download complete" is printed in the terminal.
#. Press the **RESET** button on the board.
   MCUboot will now detect the downloaded image and write it to flash.
   This can take up to a minute and nothing is printed in the terminal while this is processing.
#. Observe that LED1 and LED2 is lit.
   This indicates that version 2 or higher of the application is running.
