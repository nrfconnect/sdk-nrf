nRF9160: LwM2M Client
#####################

The LwM2M Client demonstrates how to use Lightweight Machine to Machine (`LwM2M`_) protocol to connect an nRF9160 DK to an LwM2M server such as `Leshan Demo Server`_ via LTE.
Once connected, the device can be queried to obtain GPS and sensor data, and to retrieve information about the modem.

Requirements
************
The sample supports the following development kit:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf9160dk_nrf9160ns

The sample also requires an LwM2M server URL address available on the internet.
For this sample, the URL address mentioned on the `Leshan Demo Server`_ page is used.

.. include:: /includes/spm.txt

Overview
********

`LwM2M`_ is an application layer protocol based on CoAP/UDP.
It is designed to expose various resources for reading, writing and executing via an LwM2M server in a very lightweight environment.
The nRF9160 sample sends data such as button and switch states, accelerometer data (the physical orientation of the device), temperature and GPS position.
It can also receive activation commands such as buzzer activation and light control.

   * - Button states
     - DOWN/UP
   * - Switch states
     - ON/OFF
   * - Accelerometer data

   * - GPS coordinates

.. _dtls_support:

DTLS Support
============

The sample has DTLS security enabled by default.
You need to provide the following information to the LwM2M server before you can make a successful connection:

* Client endpoint
* Identity
* Pre-shared key

The following instructions describe how to register your device and these instructions are specific to `Leshan Demo Server`_:

1. Open the Leshan Demo Server web UI.
#. Click on :guilabel:`Security` in the upper-right corner.
#. Click on :guilabel:`Add new client security configuration`.
#. Enter the following data and click :guilabel:`Create`:

    * Client endpoint - nrf-{your Device IMEI}
    * Security mode - Pre-Shared Key
    * Identity: - nrf-{your Device IMEI}
    * Key - 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f

#. :ref:`Build and run the LwM2M Client sample <build_lwm2m>`.

Configuration
*************

|config|

Configuration options
=====================

Check and configure the following configuration options for the sample:

.. option:: CONFIG_APP_LWM2M_SERVER - LWM2M Server configuration

   The sample configuration specifies the LWM2M Server to be used.
   In this sample, this option is set to ``leshan.eclipseprojects.io``.



Configuration files
===================

The sample provides predefined configuration files for typical use cases.
You can find the configuration files in the :file:`samples/nrf9160/lwm2m_client` directory.

The following files are available:

* :file:`prj.conf` - Standard default configuration file
* :file:`overlay-queue` - Enables LwM2M Queue Mode support
* :file:`overlay-bootstrap.conf` - Enables LwM2M bootstrap support

Building and Running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/nrf9160/lwm2m_client`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_nrf9160.txt


Queue Mode support
==================

To use the LwM2M Client sample with LwM2M Queue Mode support, build it with the ``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-queue.conf`` option.
See :ref:`cmake_options` for instructions on how to add this option.

Bootstrap support
=================

To build the LwM2M Client sample with LwM2M bootstrap support, build it with the ``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-bootstrap.conf`` option.
See :ref:`cmake_options` for instructions on how to add this option.

In order to successfully run the bootstrap procedure, the device must be first registered in the LwM2M bootstrap server.

The following instructions describe how to register your device and these instructions are specific to `Leshan Demo Server`_:

1. Open the Leshan Demo Server bootstrap web UI.
#. Click on :guilabel:`Add new client bootstrap configuration`.
#. Enter the client endpoint - nrf-{your device IMEI}
#. In the :guilabel:`LWM2M Bootstrap Server` tab, enter the following data:

    * Security mode - Pre-Shared Key
    * Identity - nrf-{your device IMEI}
    * Key - 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f

#. In the :guilabel:`LWM2M Server` section, choose the desired configuration (``No security`` or ``Pre-Shared Key``).
   If you choose ``Pre-Shared Key``, add the values for ``Identity`` and ``Key`` fields (the configured Identity/Key need not match the Bootstrap Server configuration).
   The same credentials will be provided in the Leshan Demo Server Security configuration page (see :ref:`dtls_support` for instructions).
   If ``No Security`` is chosen, no further configuration is needed.
   Note that in this mode, no DTLS will be used for the communication with the LwM2M server.
#. After adding values for the fields under both the :guilabel:`LWM2M Bootstrap Server` and :guilabel:`LWM2M Server` tabs, click :guilabel:`Create`.
#. :ref:`Build and run the LwM2M Client sample <build_lwm2m>`.

Testing
=======

|test_sample|

#. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal|
#. Observe that the sample starts and automatically connects to the LwM2M Server with an endpoint named "nrf-{your Device IMEI}".

.. note::
   The IMEI of your device can be found on the bottom of the nRF9160 DK near a bar code with the FCC ID at the bottom.

Sample Output
=============

The following output is logged in the terminal:
