The :ref:`Thread <ug_thread>` CoAP Server sample demonstrates controlling light resources within an OpenThread network.
This sample exposes resources in the network and requires another sample that is compatible with the OpenThread network to access them.
The recommended sample referenced on this page is :ref:`coap_client_sample`.

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates how to expose resources that can be accessed by other devices in the same Thread network.
You can use this sample application as a starting point to implement a :ref:`CoAP <zephyr:coap_sock_interface>` application.

The following CoAP resources are exposed on the network by this sample:

* ``/light`` - used to control LED 4
* ``/provisioning`` - used to perform provisioning

This sample uses the native `OpenThread CoAP API`_ for communication.
For new application development, use :ref:`Zephyr's CoAP API<zephyr:coap_sock_interface>`.
For example usage of the Zephyr CoAp API, see the :ref:`coap_client_sample` sample.

FEM support
===========

.. |fem_file_path| replace:: :file:`samples/openthread/common`

.. include:: /includes/sample_fem_support.txt

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp, nrf52840dk_nrf52840, nrf52833dk_nrf52833, nrf21540dk_nrf52840

.. note::
   The multiprotocol variant is not supported on nRF53 Series devices yet.

You can use one or more of the development kits listed above as the Thread CoAP Server.
You also need one or more compatible development kits programmed with the :ref:`coap_client_sample` sample.

User interface
**************

Button 4:
  Pressing results in entering the pairing mode for a limited period of time.

LED 1:
  On when the OpenThread connection is established.

LED 3:
  Blinks when the pairing mode is enabled.

LED 4:
  Turned on and off by messages sent from the client nodes.

Building and running
********************
.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/openthread/coap_server`

|enable_thread_before_testing|

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt

Testing
=======

After building the sample and programming it to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

#. Program at least one development kit with the :ref:`coap_client_sample` sample and reset it.
#. Turn on the Simple CoAP Client node.
   This node becomes the Thread network Leader.
#. Turn on all the other nodes, including the Simple CoAP Server nodes.
   They enter the network as Children, and will gradually become Routers.

   .. note::
      It can take up to 15 seconds for Thread to establish network.

#. Press Button 2 on the client node to control LED 4 on all server nodes.
#. Pair a client with a server by completing the following steps:

   a. Press Button 4 on a server node to enable pairing.
   #. Press Button 3 on a client node to pair it with the server node in the pairing mode.

#. Press Button 1 on the client node to control the LED 4 on paired server node.

Running OpenThread CLI commands
-------------------------------

You can connect to any of the Simple CoAP Server or Simple CoAP Client nodes through a serial port.
For more details, see :ref:`putty`.

Once the serial connection is ready, you can run OpenThread CLI commands.
For complete CLI documentation, refer to `OpenThread CLI Reference`_.

.. note::
    In Zephyr shell, every OpenThread command needs to be preceded with the `ot` keyword.
    For example, ``ot channel 20``.

Dependencies
************

This sample uses the following |NCS| libraries:

* :ref:`dk_buttons_and_leds_readme`

In addition, it uses the following Zephyr libraries:

* :ref:`zephyr:kernel_api`:

  * ``include/kernel.h``

OpenThread CoAP API is used in this sample:

* `OpenThread CoAP API`_
