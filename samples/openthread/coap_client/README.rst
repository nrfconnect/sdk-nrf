Thread: CoAP Client
###################

The Thread CoAP Client sample demonstrates controlling light resources of other nodes within an OpenThread network.
To show this interaction, the sample requires a server sample that is compatible with the OpenThread network and has a light resource available.
The recommended server sample referenced on this page is :ref:`coap_server_sample`.

.. note::
    This sample supports optional :ref:`coap_client_sample_multi_ext` and Minimal Thread Device variants.
    See :ref:`coap_client_sample_activating_variants` for details.

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates how to access resources available on a Thread server node.
After the Thread network is established, the client node can control the state of **LED 4** on server nodes.
It can turn on the LED either on every server node in the network with a multicast message, or on a single specific server node that is paired with the client node.

The following CoAP resources are accessed on the server side:

* ``/light`` - Used to control **LED 4**.
* ``/provisioning`` - Used to perform provisioning.

This sample uses :ref:`Zephyr CoAP API<zephyr:coap_sock_interface>` for communication, which is the preferred API to use for new CoAP applications.
For example usage of the native Thread CoAP API, see the :ref:`coap_server_sample` sample.

.. _coap_client_sample_multi_ext:

Multiprotocol |BLE| extension
=============================

This optional extension can demonstrate the OpenThread stack and :ref:`nrfxlib:softdevice_controller` working concurrently.
It uses the :ref:`nus_service_readme` library to control the LED states over |BLE| in a Thread network.
For more information about multiprotocol feature, see :ref:`ug_multiprotocol_support`.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf52840dk_nrf52840, nrf52833dk_nrf52833

You can use one or more of the development kits listed above as the Thread CoAP Client.
You also need one or more compatible development kits programmed with the :ref:`coap_server_sample` sample.

Multiprotocol extension requirements
====================================

If you enable the :ref:`coap_client_sample_multi_ext`, make sure you have a phone or a tablet with the `nRF Toolbox`_ application installed.

.. note::
  The :ref:`testing instructions <coap_client_sample_testing_ble>` refer to nRF Toolbox, but similar applications can be used as well, for example `nRF Connect for Mobile`_.

User interface
**************

The following LED and buttons of the client development kit are used by this sample:

LED 1:
  On when the OpenThread connection is established.

Button 1:
   Send a unicast ``LIGHT_TOGGLE`` message to the ``/light`` resource on a paired device.
   If no device is paired with the specific client node, pressing the button has no effect.

Button 2:
   Send a multicast ``LIGHT_ON`` or ``LIGHT_OFF`` message (alternatively) to the ``/light`` resource.
   Sending this multicast message instead of ``LIGHT_TOGGLE`` allows to synchronize the state of the LEDs on several server nodes.

Button 4:
   Send a multicast pairing request to the ``/provisioning`` resource.

Minimal Thread Device assignments
=================================

When the device is working as Minimal Thread Device (MTD), the following LED and Button assignments are also available:

LED 3:
    The mode the device is working in:

    * On when in the Minimal End Device (MED) mode.
    * Off when in the Sleepy End Device (SED) mode.

Button 3:
    Toggle the power consumption between SED and MED.

For more information, see :ref:`thread_ug_device_type` in the Thread user guide.

Multiprotocol |BLE| extension assignments
=========================================

LED 2:
   On when |BLE| connection is established.

UART command assignments:
   The following command assignments are configured and used in nRF Toolbox when :ref:`coap_client_sample_testing_ble`:

   * ``u`` - Send a unicast CoAP message over Thread (the same operation as **Button 1**).
   * ``m`` - Send a multicast CoAP message over Thread (the same operation as **Button 2**).
   * ``p`` - Send a pairing request as CoAP message over Thread (the same operation as **Button 4**).

.. _coap_client_sample_activating_variants:

Activating sample extensions
============================

To activate the optional extensions supported by this sample, modify :makevar:`OVERLAY_CONFIG` in the following manner:

* For the Minimal Thread Device variant, set :file:`overlay-mtd.conf`.
* For the Multiprotocol BLE extension, set :file:`overlay-multiprotocol_ble.conf`.

See :ref:`cmake_options` for instructions on how to add this option.

Testing
=======

After building the sample and programming it to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

#. Program at least one development kit with :ref:`coap_server_sample` and reset it.
#. Turn on the CoAP Client and at least one CoAP Server.
   They will create the Thread network.

   .. note::
     It may take up to 15 seconds for nodes to establish the network.
     When the sample application is ready, the **LED 1** starts blinking.

#. Press **Button 2** on a client node to control **LED 4** on all server nodes.
#. Pair a client with a server by completing the following steps:

   a. Press **Button 4** on a server node to enable pairing.
   #. Press **Button 4** on a client node to pair it with the server node in the pairing mode.

#. Press **Button 1** on the client node to control the **LED 4** on the paired server node.

.. _coap_client_sample_testing_mtd:

Testing Minimal Thread Device
-----------------------------

After building the MTD variant of this sample and programming it, the device starts in the SED mode with **LED 3** off.
This means that the radio is disabled when idle and the serial console is not working to decrease the power consumption.
You can switch to the MED mode at any moment during the standard testing procedure.

To toggle MED, press **Button 3** on the client node.
**LED 3** turns on to indicate the switch to the MED mode.
At this point, the radio is enabled when it is idle and the serial console is operating.

Pressing **Button 3** again will switch the mode back to SED.
Switching between SED and MED modes does not affect the standard testing procedure, but terminal logs are not available in the SED mode.

.. _coap_client_sample_testing_ble:

Testing multiprotocol |BLE| extension
