The :ref:`Thread <ug_thread>` CLI sample demonstrates how to send commands to a Thread device using the OpenThread Command Line Interface (CLI).
The CLI is integrated into the Zephyr shell.

This sample supports optional :ref:`ot_cli_sample_thread_v12`, which can be turned on or off.
See :ref:`coap_client_sample_activating_variants` for details.

Overview
********

The sample demonstrates the usage of commands listed in `OpenThread CLI Reference`_.
OpenThread CLI is integrated into the system shell accessible over serial connection.
To indicate a Thread command, the ``ot`` keyword needs to precede the command.

The amount of commands you can test depends on the application configuration.
The CLI sample comes with the :ref:`full set of OpenThread functionalities <thread_ug_feature_sets>` enabled (:option:`CONFIG_OPENTHREAD_NORDIC_LIBRARY_MASTER`).

If used alone, the sample allows you to test the network status.
It is recommended to use at least two development kits running the same sample to be able to test communication.

.. _ot_cli_sample_diag_module:

Diagnostic module
=================

By default, the CLI sample comes with the :option:`CONFIG_OPENTHREAD_NORDIC_LIBRARY_MASTER` :ref:`feature set <thread_ug_feature_sets>` enabled, which allows you to use Zephyr's diagnostic module with its ``diag`` commands.
Use these commands for manually checking hardware-related functionalities without running a Thread network.
For example, when adding a new functionality or during the manufacturing process to ensure radio communication is working.
See `Testing diagnostic module`_ section for an example.

.. note::
    If you disable the :option:`CONFIG_OPENTHREAD_NORDIC_LIBRARY_MASTER` feature set, you can enable the diagnostic module with the :option:`CONFIG_OPENTHREAD_DIAG` Kconfig option.

.. _ot_cli_sample_thread_v12:

Experimental Thread 1.2 extension
=================================

This optional extension allows you to test :ref:`available features from the Thread 1.2 Specification <thread_ug_thread_1_2>`.
You can enable these features either by :ref:`activating the overlay extension <ot_cli_sample_activating_variants>` as described below or by setting :ref:`thread_ug_thread_1_2`.

.. _ot_cli_sample_thread_certification:

Certification tests with CLI sample
===================================

The Thread CLI sample can be used for running certification tests.
See :ref:`ug_thread_cert` for information on how to use this sample on Thread Certification Test Harness.

.. _ot_cli_sample_minimal:

Minimal configuration
=====================

This optional extension demonstrates an optimized configuration for the Thread CLI sample.
The provided configurations optimize the memory footprint of the sample for single protocol and multiprotocol use.

For more information, see :ref:`app_memory`.

FEM support
===========

.. |fem_file_path| replace:: :file:`samples/openthread/common`

.. include:: /includes/sample_fem_support.txt

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits for testing the network status:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp, nrf52840dk_nrf52840, nrf52833dk_nrf52833, nrf21540dk_nrf52840

Optionally, you can use one or more compatible development kits programmed with this sample or another :ref:`Thread sample <openthread_samples>` for :ref:`testing communication or diagnostics <ot_cli_sample_testing_multiple>` and :ref:`thread_ot_commissioning_configuring_on-mesh`.

Thread 1.2 extension requirements
=================================

If you enable the :ref:`ot_cli_sample_thread_v12`, you will need `nRF Sniffer for 802.15.4`_ to observe messages sent from the router to the leader kit when :ref:`ot_cli_sample_testing_multiple_v12`.

User interface
**************

All the interactions with the application are handled using serial communication.
See `OpenThread CLI Reference`_ for the list of available serial commands.

Testing
=======

After building the sample and programming it to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

#. Turn on the development kit.
#. Set up the serial connection with the development kit.
   For more details, see :ref:`putty`.

   .. note::
        |thread_hwfc_enabled|

#. .. include:: /includes/thread_configure_network.txt
#. .. include:: /includes/thread_enable_network.txt
#. Invoke some of the OpenThread commands:

   a. Test the state of the Thread network with the ``ot state`` command.
      For example:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot state
         leader
         Done

   #. Get the Thread network name with the ``ot networkname`` command.
      For example:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot networkname
         ot_zephyr
         Done

   #. Get the IP addresses of the current thread network with the ``ot ipaddr`` command.
      For example:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot ipaddr
         fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:800
         fdde:ad00:beef:0:3102:d00b:5cbe:a61
         fe80:0:0:0:8467:5746:a29f:1196
         Done

.. _ot_cli_sample_testing_multiple:

Testing with more kits
----------------------

If you are using more than one development kit for testing the CLI sample, you can also complete additional testing procedures.

.. note::
    The following testing procedures assume you are using two development kits.

Testing communication between kits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test communication between kits, complete the following steps:

#. Make sure both development kits are programmed with the CLI sample.
#. Turn on the developments kits.
#. Set up the serial connection with both development kits.
   For more details, see :ref:`putty`.

   .. note::
        |thread_hwfc_enabled|

#. .. include:: /includes/thread_configure_network.txt
#. .. include:: /includes/thread_enable_network.txt
#. Test communication between the kits with the following command:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      ot ping *ip_address_of_the_first_kit*

   For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot ping fdde:ad00:beef:0:3102:d00b:5cbe:a61
      16 bytes from fdde:ad00:beef:0:3102:d00b:5cbe:a61: icmp_seq=1 hlim=64 time=22ms

Testing diagnostic module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test diagnostic commands, complete the following steps:

#. Make sure both development kits are programmed with the CLI sample.
#. Turn on the developments kits.
#. Set up the serial connection with both development kits.
   For more details, see :ref:`putty`.

   .. note::
        |thread_hwfc_enabled|.

#. Make sure that the diagnostic module is enabled and configured with proper radio channel and transmission power by running the following commands on both devices:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot diag start
      start diagnostics mode
      status 0x00
      Done
      uart:~$ ot diag channel 11
      set channel to 11
      status 0x00
      Done
      uart:~$ ot diag power 0
      set tx power to 0 dBm
      status 0x00
      Done

#. Transmit a fixed number of packets with the given length from one of the devices.
   For example, to transmit 20 packets that contain 100 B of random data, run the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot diag send 20 100
      sending 0x14 packet(s), length 0x64
      status 0x00
      Done

#. Read the radio statistics on the other device by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot diag stats
      received packets: 20
      sent packets: 0
      first received packet: rssi=-29, lqi=255
      last received packet: rssi=-30, lqi=255
      Done

.. _ot_cli_sample_testing_multiple_v12:

Testing Thread 1.2 features

#. Test the state of the Thread network with the ``ot state`` command to see which kit is the leader:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot state
      leader
      Done

#. On the leader kit, enable the Backbone Router function:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot bbr enable
      DIo:
       State changed! Flags: 0x02001000 Current role: 4
      I: State changed! Flags: 0x00000200 Current role: 4
      I: State changed! Flags: 0x02000001 Current role: 4

#. On the leader kit, configure the Domain prefix:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot prefix add fd00:7d03:7d03:7d03::/64 prosD med
      Done

      ff03:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
      ff03:0:0:0:0:0:0:fc
      Done

   The router kit will send an ``MLR.req`` message to the leader kit (Backbone Router).
   This can be observed using the `nRF Sniffer for 802.15.4`_.

   .. note::
        The DUA registration with the Backbone Router is not yet supported.
