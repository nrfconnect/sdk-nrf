The :ref:`Thread <ug_thread>` CLI sample demonstrates how to send commands to a Thread device using the OpenThread Command Line Interface (CLI).
The CLI is integrated into the Zephyr shell.

This sample supports optional :ref:`ot_cli_sample_thread_v12`, which can be turned on or off.
See :ref:`coap_client_sample_activating_variants` for details.

Overview
********

The sample demonstrates the usage of commands listed in `OpenThread CLI Reference`_.
OpenThread CLI is integrated into the system shell accessible over serial connection.
To indicate a Thread command, the ``ot`` keyword needs to precede the command.

The amount of commands you can test depends on the application configuration.
The CLI sample comes with the :ref:`full set of OpenThread functionalities <thread_ug_feature_sets>` enabled (:option:`CONFIG_OPENTHREAD_NORDIC_LIBRARY_MASTER`).

If used alone, the sample allows you to test the network status.
It is recommended to use at least two development kits running the same sample to be able to test communication.

.. _ot_cli_sample_diag_module:

Diagnostic module
=================

By default, the CLI sample comes with the :option:`CONFIG_OPENTHREAD_NORDIC_LIBRARY_MASTER` :ref:`feature set <thread_ug_feature_sets>` enabled, which allows you to use Zephyr's diagnostic module with its ``diag`` commands.
Use these commands for manually checking hardware-related functionalities without running a Thread network.
For example, when adding a new functionality or during the manufacturing process to ensure radio communication is working.
See `Testing diagnostic module`_ section for an example.

.. note::
    If you disable the :option:`CONFIG_OPENTHREAD_NORDIC_LIBRARY_MASTER` feature set, you can enable the diagnostic module with the :option:`CONFIG_OPENTHREAD_DIAG` Kconfig option.

.. _ot_cli_sample_thread_v12:

Experimental Thread 1.2 extension
=================================

This optional extension allows you to test :ref:`available features from the Thread 1.2 Specification <thread_ug_thread_1_2>`.
You can enable these features either by :ref:`activating the overlay extension <ot_cli_sample_activating_variants>` as described below or by setting :ref:`thread_ug_thread_1_2`.

.. _ot_cli_sample_thread_certification:

Certification tests with CLI sample
===================================

The Thread CLI sample can be used for running certification tests.
See :ref:`ug_thread_cert` for information on how to use this sample on Thread Certification Test Harness.

.. _ot_cli_sample_minimal:

Minimal configuration
=====================

This optional extension demonstrates an optimized configuration for the Thread CLI sample.
The provided configurations optimize the memory footprint of the sample for single protocol and multiprotocol use.

For more information, see :ref:`app_memory`.

FEM support
===========

.. |fem_file_path| replace:: :file:`samples/openthread/common`

.. include:: /includes/sample_fem_support.txt

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits for testing the network status:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp, nrf52840dk_nrf52840, nrf52833dk_nrf52833, nrf21540dk_nrf52840

Optionally, you can use one or more compatible development kits programmed with this sample or another :ref:`Thread sample <openthread_samples>` for :ref:`testing communication or diagnostics <ot_cli_sample_testing_multiple>` and :ref:`thread_ot_commissioning_configuring_on-mesh`.

Thread 1.2 extension requirements
=================================

If you enable the :ref:`ot_cli_sample_thread_v12`, you will need `nRF Sniffer for 802.15.4`_ to observe messages sent from the router to the leader kit when :ref:`ot_cli_sample_testing_multiple_v12`.

User interface
**************

All the interactions with the application are handled using serial communication.
See `OpenThread CLI Reference`_ for the list of available serial commands.

Testing
=======

After building the sample and programming it to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

#. Turn on the development kit.
#. Set up the serial connection with the development kit.
   For more details, see :ref:`putty`.

   .. note::
        |thread_hwfc_enabled|

#. .. include:: /includes/thread_configure_network.txt
#. .. include:: /includes/thread_enable_network.txt
#. Invoke some of the OpenThread commands:

   a. Test the state of the Thread network with the ``ot state`` command.
      For example:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot state
         leader
         Done

   #. Get the Thread network name with the ``ot networkname`` command.
      For example:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot networkname
         ot_zephyr
         Done

   #. Get the IP addresses of the current thread network with the ``ot ipaddr`` command.
      For example:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot ipaddr
         fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:800
         fdde:ad00:beef:0:3102:d00b:5cbe:a61
         fe80:0:0:0:8467:5746:a29f:1196
         Done

.. _ot_cli_sample_testing_multiple:

Testing with more kits
----------------------

If you are using more than one development kit for testing the CLI sample, you can also complete additional testing procedures.

.. note::
    The following testing procedures assume you are using two development kits.

Testing communication between kits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test communication between kits, complete the following steps:

#. Make sure both development kits are programmed with the CLI sample.
#. Turn on the developments kits.
#. Set up the serial connection with both development kits.
   For more details, see :ref:`putty`.

   .. note::
        |thread_hwfc_enabled|

#. .. include:: /includes/thread_configure_network.txt
#. .. include:: /includes/thread_enable_network.txt
#. Test communication between the kits with the following command:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      ot ping *ip_address_of_the_first_kit*

   For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot ping fdde:ad00:beef:0:3102:d00b:5cbe:a61
      16 bytes from fdde:ad00:beef:0:3102:d00b:5cbe:a61: icmp_seq=1 hlim=64 time=22ms

Testing diagnostic module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test diagnostic commands, complete the following steps:

#. Make sure both development kits are programmed with the CLI sample.
#. Turn on the developments kits.
#. Set up the serial connection with both development kits.
   For more details, see :ref:`putty`.

   .. note::
        |thread_hwfc_enabled|.

#. Make sure that the diagnostic module is enabled and configured with proper radio channel and transmission power by running the following commands on both devices:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot diag start
      start diagnostics mode
      status 0x00
      Done
      uart:~$ ot diag channel 11
      set channel to 11
      status 0x00
      Done
      uart:~$ ot diag power 0
      set tx power to 0 dBm
      status 0x00
      Done

#. Transmit a fixed number of packets with the given length from one of the devices.
   For example, to transmit 20 packets that contain 100 B of random data, run the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot diag send 20 100
      sending 0x14 packet(s), length 0x64
      status 0x00
      Done

#. Read the radio statistics on the other device by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot diag stats
      received packets: 20
      sent packets: 0
      first received packet: rssi=-29, lqi=255
      last received packet: rssi=-30, lqi=255
      Done

.. _ot_cli_sample_testing_multiple_v12:

Testing Thread 1.2 features

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot state
      leader
      Done

#. On the leader kit, enable the Backbone Router function:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot bbr enable
      DIo:
       State changed! Flags: 0x02001000 Current role: 4
      I: State changed! Flags: 0x00000200 Current role: 4
      I: State changed! Flags: 0x02000001 Current role: 4

#. On the leader kit, configure the Domain prefix:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot prefix add fd00:7d03:7d03:7d03::/64 prosD med
      Done
      uart:~$ ot netdata register
      Done
      I: State changed! Flags: 0x00000200 Current role: 4
      I: State changed! Flags: 0x00001001 Current role: 4

#. On the router kit, display the autoconfigured Domain Unicast Address and set another one manually:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot ipaddr
      fd00:7d03:7d03:7d03:ee2d:eed:4b59:2736
      fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:c400
      fdde:ad00:beef:0:e0fc:dc28:1d12:8c2
      fe80:0:0:0:acbd:53bf:1461:a861
      uart:~$ ot dua iid 0004000300020001
      Io:
      State changed! Flags: 0x00000003 Current role: 3
      uart:~$ ot ipaddr
      fd00:7d03:7d03:7d03:4:3:2:1
      fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:c400
      fdde:ad00:beef:0:e0fc:dc28:1d12:8c2
      fe80:0:0:0:acbd:53bf:1461:a861
      Done

#. On the router kit, configure a multicast address with a scope greater than realm-local:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot ipmaddr add ff04::1
      Done
      : State changed! Flags: 0x00001000 Current role: 3
      uart:~$ ot ipmaddr
      ff04:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
      ff33:40:fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:1
      ff32:40:fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:1

      ff03:0:0:0:0:0:0:2
      ff02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
      ff03:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
      ff03:0:0:0:0:0:0:fc
      Done

   The router kit will send an ``MLR.req`` message and a ``DUA.req`` message to the leader kit (Backbone Router).
   This can be observed using the `nRF Sniffer for 802.15.4`_.

#. On the leader kit, list the IPv6 addresses:

   .. code-block:: console

      uart:~$ ot ipaddr
      fd00:7d03:7d03:7d03:84c9:572d:be24:cbe
      fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:fc10
      fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:fc38
      fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:fc00
      fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:7000
      fdde:ad00:beef:0:a318:bf4f:b9c6:5f7d
      fe80:0:0:0:10b1:93ea:c0ee:eeb7

   Note down the link-local address.
   You must use this address when sending Link Metrics commands from the router kit to the leader kit.

   The following steps use the address ``fe80:0:0:0:10b1:93ea:c0ee:eeb7``.
   Replace it with the link-local address of your leader kit in all commands.

#. Run the following commands on the router kit:

   a. Reattach the router kit as SED with a polling period of 3 seconds:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot pollperiod 3000
         Done
         uart:~$ ot mode -
         Done

   #. Perform a Link Metrics query (Single Probe):

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot linkmetrics query fe80:0:0:0:10b1:93ea:c0ee:eeb7 single qmr
         Done
         Received Link Metrics Report from: fe80:0:0:0:10b1:93ea:c0ee:eeb7
         - LQI: 220 (Exponential Moving Average)
         - Margin: 60 (dB) (Exponential Moving Average)
         - RSSI: -40 (dBm) (Exponential Moving Average)

   #. Send a Link Metrics Management Request to configure a Forward Tracking Series:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot linkmetrics mgmt fe80:0:0:0:10b1:93ea:c0ee:eeb7 forward 1 dra pqmr
         Done
         Received Link Metrics Management Response from: fe80:0:0:0:10b1:93ea:c0ee:eeb7
         Status: Success

   #. Send an MLE Link Probe message to the peer:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot linkmetrics probe fe80:0:0:0:10b1:93ea:c0ee:eeb7 1 10
         Done

   #. Perform a Link Metrics query (Forward Tracking Series):

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot linkmetrics query fe80:0:0:0:10b1:93ea:c0ee:eeb7 forward 1
         Done
         Received Link Metrics Report from: fe80:0:0:0:10b1:93ea:c0ee:eeb7
         - PDU Counter: 13 (Count/Summation)
         - LQI: 212 (Exponential Moving Average)
         - Margin: 60 (dB) (Exponential Moving Average)
         - RSSI: -40 (dBm) (Exponential Moving Average)

   #. Send a Link Metrics Management Request to register an Enhanced ACK-based Probing:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot linkmetrics mgmt fe80:0:0:0:10b1:93ea:c0ee:eeb7 enhanced-ack register qm
         Done
         Received Link Metrics Management Response from: fe80:0:0:0:10b1:93ea:c0ee:eeb7
         Status: Success

   #. Send a Link Metrics Management Request to clear an Enhanced ACK-based Probing:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot linkmetrics mgmt fe80:0:0:0:10b1:93ea:c0ee:eeb7 enhanced-ack clear
         Done
         Received Link Metrics Management Response from: fe80:0:0:0:10b1:93ea:c0ee:eeb7
         Status: Success

#. Verify the Coordinated Sampled Listening (CSL) functionality.

   The following steps use the address ``fe80:0:0:0:acbd:53bf:1461:a861``.
   Replace it with the link-local address of your router kit in all commands.

   a. Send an ICMPv6 Echo Request from the leader kit to link-local address of the router kit:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot ping fe80:0:0:0:acbd:53bf:1461:a861
         16 bytes from fe80:0:0:0:acbd:53bf:1461:a861: icmp_seq=2 hlim=64 time=2494ms
         1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received. Packet loss = 0.0%. Round-trip min/a
         Done

      Observe that there is a long latency on the reply of up to 3000 ms.
      This is due to the indirect transmission mechanism based on data polling.

   #. Enable a CSL Receiver on the router kit (now SED) by configuring a CSL period of 0.5 seconds:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot csl period 3125
         Done

   #. Send an ICMPv6 Echo Request from the leader kit to the link-local address of the router kit:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ ot ping fe80:0:0:0:acbd:53bf:1461:a861
         uart:~$ W: TX_STARTED event will be triggered without delay
         16 bytes from fe80:0:0:0:acbd:53bf:1461:a861: icmp_seq=3 hlim=64 time=421ms
         1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received. Packet loss = 0.0%. Round-trip min/a
         Done

      Observe that the reply latency is reduced to a value below 500 ms.
      The reduction occurs because the transmission from the leader is performed via CSL, based on the CSL Information Elements sent by the CSL Receiver.
