	  the application.

	  The following RPMsg samples may be included when this setting is enabled:
	  In order of precedence:
	  - Multiprotocol RPMsg: When both Bluetooth and nRF IEEE 802.15.4 Serialization host are enabled.
	  - HCI RPMsg: When only Bluetooth is enabled
	  - nRF IEEE 802.15.4 Serialization RPMsg: When only nRF IEEE 802.15.4 Serialization host is enabled.
	  - nRF RPC Host: When Bluetooth and Bluetooth serialization over RPC are enabled.
	  - nRF BLE radio test: When both Wi-Fi and BLE radio test are enabled for testing SR co-existence.
