	  Enabling this setting will include a network stack to run on the
	  network core and communicate over RPMsg with the application core.
	  The application core does not have access to the radio peripheral.

	  The network core sample to be included depends on the configuration of
	  the application.

	  The following RPMsg samples may be included when this setting is enabled:
	  In order of precedence:
	  - Multiprotocol RPMsg: When both Bluetooth and nRF IEEE 802.15.4 Serialization host are enabled.
	  - HCI RPMsg: When only Bluetooth is enabled
	  - nRF IEEE 802.15.4 Serialization RPMsg: When only nRF IEEE 802.15.4 Serialization host is enabled.
	  - nRF RPC Host: When Bluetooth and Bluetooth serialization over RPC are enabled.
	  - nRF BLE radio test: When both Wi-Fi and BLE radio test are enabled for testing SR co-existence.
