BH1749: Ambient Light Sensor IC
#####################################################

This sample application sets up the BH1749 color sensor to provide 8-bit
measurement data every time a set threshold value (>50) is reached for the
RED color channel.
It also shows how to enable interrupt every time data is ready, instead
of threshold trigging.


Requirements
************

The sample supports the following nRF9160-based device:

.. include:: /includes/boardname_tables/sample_boardnames.txt
   :start-after: set10_start
   :end-before: set10_end

Building and Running
********************

This project outputs sensor data to the console. It requires a BH1749
sensor. It should work with any platform featuring a I2C peripheral interface.
It does not work on QEMU.
The example below uses the Thingy:91.
