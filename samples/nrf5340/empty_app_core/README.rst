nRF5340: Empty firmware for application core

This sample can be used to run an application on the network core of the nRF5340 when there is no need for the working application core.

Overview
********

The sample has minimal Zephyr configuration: no multithreading, no clock, no MPU, no device drivers.
It does the following things:

* During system initialization:

  * It allows the network core to access GPIO pins for LEDs and buttons.
    If more pins are required, you can add them to the :c:func:`network_gpio_allow` function.
  * It starts the network core.
    This is not done directly in the source code of the sample, but internally by Zephyr.

* In the :c:func:`main` function of the sample:

  * The application RAM is powered off to reduce power consumption.
  * The application core is suspended indefinitely.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kit:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/nrf5340/empty_app_core`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt

Testing
=======
1. Program this sample to the application core.
#. Program the Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:blinky-sample` to the network core.
#. Observe the LEDs on the kit.

Dependencies
************

This sample uses the following `nrfx`_ dependencies:

* ``nrfx/nrf.h``
* ``nrfx/nrfx.h``

In addition, it uses the following Zephyr libraries:

* :ref:`zephyr:kernel_api`:

  * ``include/init.h``
