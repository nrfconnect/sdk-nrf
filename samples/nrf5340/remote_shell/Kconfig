config REMOTE_SHELL_TX_RING_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Set TX ring buffer size"
	default 64
	help
	  If UART is utilizing DMA transfers then increasing ring buffer size
	  increases transfers length and reduces number of interrupts. It is used
	  to collect data from transport medium and passing it to remote shell.

	int "Set RX ring buffer size"
	default 64
	help

config REMOTE_SHELL_UART_DEV
	string "UART device name"
	default "CDC_ACM_0"
