NFC: Shell
##########

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 2

This sample demonstrates the NFC transport feature for a shell interface.
It runs the shell interface with the NFC T4T ISO-DEP transport layer.
It uses the :ref:`shell_nfc_readme` library.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

The sample also requires the polling device with support for raw ISO-DEP (ISO14443-4A) protocol.
The polling device must follow data exchange mechanism described in the :ref:`shell_nfc_readme` library.

Overview
********

This sample presents one of possible ways to run shell through the NFC T4T transport layer.
This is not a common use case for NFC as an NFC tag is a passive device.
However, this feature can be useful, for example, for devices provisioning on the production line.
This sample runs a shell over the NFC transport and implements two shell commands that control the LED.

You can use the following commands:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF52 and nRF53 DKs

      * The ``led on`` command lits **LED 2**.
      * The ``led off`` command dims **LED 2**.

   .. group-tab:: nRF54 DKs

      * The ``led on`` command lits **LED 1**.
      * The ``led off`` command dims **LED 1**.

User interface
**************

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF52 and nRF53 DKs

      LED 1:
         Blinks, toggling on/off every second, when the main loop is running.

      LED 2:
         Lits or dims when user issues the shell commands that control the LED.

   .. group-tab:: nRF54 DKs

      LED 0:
         Blinks, toggling on/off every second, when the main loop is running.

      LED 1:
         Lits or dims when user issues the shell commands that control the LED.

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, complete the following steps to test it:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF52 and nRF53 DKs

      1. |connect_terminal_ANSI|
      #. Reset your development kit.
      #. Observe that the sample starts.
      #. Touch the NFC antenna with the polling device.
      #. Observe that the shell prompt appears on the terminal.
      #. Keep the NFC antenna in the polling device field range.
      #. Issue the ``led on`` command through the terminal.
      #. Observe that the **LED 2** lits.
      #. Issue the ``led off`` command through the terminal.
      #. Observe that the **LED 2** dims.
      #. You can play with other build-in shell commands.

   .. group-tab:: nRF54 DKs

      1. |connect_terminal_ANSI|
      #. Reset your development kit.
      #. Observe that the sample starts.
      #. Touch the NFC antenna with the polling device.
      #. Observe that the shell prompt appears on the terminal.
      #. Keep the NFC antenna in the polling device field range.
      #. Issue the ``led on`` command through the terminal.
      #. Observe that the **LED 1** lits.
      #. Issue the ``led off`` command through the terminal.
      #. Observe that the **LED 1** dims.
      #. You can play with other build-in shell commands.
