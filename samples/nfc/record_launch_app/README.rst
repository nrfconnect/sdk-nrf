The NFC Launch App sample shows how to use the NFC tag to launch an app on the polling smartphone.
It uses the :ref:`lib_nfc_ndef` library.

Requirements
************

This sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

The sample also requires a smartphone or a tablet.
You need to have the `nRF Toolbox`_ app installed for iOS devices.

Overview
********

When the sample starts, it initializes the NFC tag and generates an NDEF message with two records that contain the app Universal Link and Android Application Record.
Then it sets up the NFC library to use the generated message and sense the external NFC field.

The only events handled by the application are the NFC events.

User interface
**************

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF52 and nRF53 DKs

      LED 1:
         Indicates if an NFC field is present.

   .. group-tab:: nRF54 DKs

      LED 0:
         Indicates if an NFC field is present.

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, complete the following steps to test it:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF52 and nRF53 DKs

      1. Touch the NFC antenna with the smartphone or tablet and observe that **LED 1** is lit.
      #. Observe that the smartphone or tablet launches the `nRF Toolbox`_ application.
      #. Move the smartphone or tablet away from the NFC antenna and observe that **LED 1**
         turns off.

   .. group-tab:: nRF54 DKs

      1. Touch the NFC antenna with the smartphone or tablet and observe that **LED 0** is lit.
      #. Observe that the smartphone or tablet launches the `nRF Toolbox`_ application.
      #. Move the smartphone or tablet away from the NFC antenna and observe that **LED 0**
         turns off.

.. note::
   Devices running iOS require the nRF Toolbox app to be installed before testing the sample.
   Devices running Android open Google Play when the application is not installed.

Dependencies
************

This sample uses the following |NCS| libraries:

* :ref:`nfc_launch_app`
