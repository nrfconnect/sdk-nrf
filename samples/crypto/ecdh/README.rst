The ECDH sample shows how to perform an Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange to allow two parties to obtain a shared secret.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

Overview
********

The sample performs the following operations:

1. Initialization:

   a. The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) API is initialized.
   #. Two random Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) key pairs are generated and imported into the PSA crypto keystore.

#. ECDH key exchange using the generated key pairs.

#. Cleanup:

   a. The key pairs are removed from the PSA crypto keystore.
