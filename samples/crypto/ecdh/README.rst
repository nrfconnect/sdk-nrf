Crypto: ECDH
############

The ECDH sample shows how to perform an Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange to allow two parties to obtain a shared secret.

Overview
********

The sample follows these steps to perform an ECDH key exchange:

1. First, the sample performs initialization:

   a. The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) API is initialized.
   #. Two random Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) key pairs are generated and imported into the PSA crypto keystore.

#. Then, ECDH key exchange is performed using the generated key pairs.

#. Afterwards, the sample performs cleanup:

   a. The key pairs are removed from the PSA crypto keystore.

Requirements

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

1. |connect_terminal|
#. Compile and program the application.
#. Observe the logs from the application using an RTT Viewer or a terminal emulator.

.. note::
   By default, the sample is configured to use both RTT and UART for logging.
   If you are using RTT, skip the first step of the testing procedure.
