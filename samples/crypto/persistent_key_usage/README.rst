The persistent key sample shows how to generate a persistent key using the Platform Security Architecture (PSA) APIs.
Persistent keys are stored in the Internal Trusted Storage (ITS) of the device and retain their value between resets.
A persistent key becomes unusable when the ``psa_destroy_key`` function is called.

Overview
********

In this sample, an AES 128-bit key is created (CTR block cipher mode) for demonstration purposes.
Persistent keys can be of any type supported by the PSA APIs.

1. First, the sample initializes the Platform Security Architecture (PSA) API.

#. Then, it generates a persistent AES 128-bit key.

#. Afterwards, the sample performs cleanup.
   The AES key is removed from the PSA crypto keystore.


.. note::
   There is a read-only type of persistent keys which cannot be destroyed with ``psa_destroy_key``.
   The ``PSA_KEY_PERSISTENCE_READ_ONLY`` persistence macro is used for read-only keys.
   The key ID of a read-only key is writable again after a full erase of the device memory is performed using the ``west -v flash --erase`` command.

Requirements

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

1. |connect_terminal|
#. Compile and program the application.
#. Observe the logs from the application using an RTT Viewer or a terminal emulator.

.. note::
   By default, the sample is configured to use both RTT and UART for logging.
   If you are using RTT, skip the first step of the testing procedure.
