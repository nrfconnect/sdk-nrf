Crypto: RSA
###########

The RSA sample shows how to perform singing and verification of a sample plaintext using a 1024-bit key.

Overview
********

The sample follows these steps:

1. First, the sample performs initialization:

   a. The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) API is initialized.
   #. A random RSA key pair is generated and imported into the PSA crypto keystore.
   #. The public key of the RSA key pair is imported into the PSA crypto keystore.

#. Then, RSA signing and verification is performed:

   a. Signing is performed using the RSA private key.
   #. The signature is verified using the exported public key.

#. Afterwards, the sample performs cleanup:

   a. The RSA key pair and public key are removed from the PSA crypto keystore.

Requirements

The sample supports the following development kits:

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

1. |connect_terminal|
#. Compile and program the application.
#. Observe the logs from the application using an RTT Viewer or a terminal emulator.

.. note::
   By default, the sample is configured to use both RTT and UART for logging.
   If you are using RTT, skip the first step of the testing procedure.
