Crypto: RNG
###########

The RNG sample shows how to produce random numbers.

Overview
********

The sample produces random numbers of 100-byte length.

1. First, the sample initializes the Platform Security Architecture (PSA) API.

#. Then, it generates five 100-byte random numbers.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows:  nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp_ns, nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp, nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns, nrf9160dk_nrf9160, nrf52840dk_nrf52840

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

Building and running

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

1. |connect_terminal|
#. Compile and program the application.
#. Observe the logs from the application using an RTT Viewer or a terminal emulator.

.. note::
   By default, the sample is configured to use both RTT and UART for logging.
   If you are using RTT, skip the first step of the testing procedure.
