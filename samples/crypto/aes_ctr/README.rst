The AES CTR sample shows how to perform AES encryption and decryption operations using the CTR block cipher mode without padding using a 128-bit AES key.

Overview
********

The sample follows these steps:

1. First, the sample performs initialization:

   a. The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) API is initialized.
   #. A random AES key is generated and imported into the PSA crypto keystore.

#. Then, it encrypts and decrypts a sample plaintext:

   a. A random initialization vector (IV) is generated.
   #. Encryption is performed.
   #. Decryption is performed.

#. Afterwards, it performs cleanup:

   a. The AES key is removed from the PSA crypto keystore.

Requirements

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

1. |connect_terminal|
#. Compile and program the application.
#. Observe the logs from the application using an RTT Viewer or a terminal emulator.

.. note::
   By default, the sample is configured to use both RTT and UART for logging.
   If you are using RTT, skip the first step of the testing procedure.
