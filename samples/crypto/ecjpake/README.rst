The EC J-PAKE sample demonstrates how to use the :ref:`PSA Crypto API <ug_psa_certified_api_overview_crypto>` to perform password-authenticated key exchange using the EC J-PAKE algorithm.
The sample uses the elliptic curve (EC) version of the password-authenticated key exchange by juggling (J-PAKE) protocol with a shared password.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

Overview
********

The sample :ref:`enables PSA Crypto API <psa_crypto_support_enable>` and configures the following Kconfig options for the cryptographic features:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_ECC_PUBLIC_KEY` - Used to enable support for ECC public key types from among the supported cryptographic operations for :ref:`ug_crypto_supported_features_key_types`.
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_WANT_ALG_JPAKE` - Used to enable support for the J-PAKE key agreement algorithm from among the supported cryptographic operations for :ref:`ug_crypto_supported_features_pake_algorithms`.
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSA_WANT_ALG_SHA_256` - Used to enable support for the SHA-256 hash algorithm from among the supported cryptographic operations for :ref:`ug_crypto_supported_features_hash_algorithms`.

Once built and run, the sample performs the following operations:

1. Initialization:

   a. The PSA Crypto API is initialized using :c:func:`psa_crypto_init`.
   #. A password key is imported using :c:func:`psa_import_key` with the ``PSA_KEY_TYPE_PASSWORD`` type.
      The key is configured with usage flags for key derivation.

#. EC J-PAKE key exchange:

   a. PAKE operations are set up for both client and server using :c:func:`psa_pake_setup`.
   #. Key exchange rounds are performed using :c:func:`psa_pake_output` and :c:func:`psa_pake_input`.
      This includes key sharing, zero-knowledge public values, and zero-knowledge proofs.
   #. Shared secrets are derived using :c:func:`psa_pake_get_shared_key` and key derivation functions.
   #. The derived secrets are compared to verify that both parties obtained the same shared secret.

#. Cleanup:

   a. The password key is removed from the PSA crypto keystore using :c:func:`psa_destroy_key`.
