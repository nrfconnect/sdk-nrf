The Chacha20-Poly1305 sample shows how to perform authenticated encryption and decryption operations.
The sample uses additional data and a random nonce.

Overview
********

The sample follows these steps:

1. First, the sample performs initialization:

   a. The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) API is initialized.
   #. A random Chacha20 key is generated and imported into the PSA crypto keystore.

#. Then, it encrypts and decrypts a sample plaintext:

   a. A random nonce is generated.
   #. Authenticated encryption is performed.
   #. Authenticated decryption is performed.

#. Afterwards, it performs cleanup:

   a. The AES key is removed from the PSA crypto keystore.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

1. |connect_terminal|
#. Compile and program the application.
#. Observe the logs from the application using an RTT Viewer or a terminal emulator.

.. note::
   By default, the sample is configured to use both RTT and UART for logging.
   If you are using RTT, skip the first step of the testing procedure.
