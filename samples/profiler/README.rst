Profiler
########

The Profiler sample demonstrates the functionality of the :ref:`profiler` subsystem.
It shows how to use the Profiler to log and visualize data about custom events that are not part of the :ref:`event_manager`.

Overview
********

The sample initializes the :ref:`profiler`, registers two event types, and profiles their occurrences periodically.

Event without data (``no data event``):
  This event is used to signal the occurrence of an event only.
  It does not contain additional data.

Event with data (``data event``):
  There are several numerical values associated with this event.
  The values are updated periodically.


Requirements
************

* One of the following development boards:

  * nRF9160 DK board (PCA10090)
  * nRF52840 Development Kit board (PCA10056)
  * nRF52 Development Kit board (PCA10040)
  * nRF51 Development Kit board (PCA10028)


Building and running
********************

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your board, you can test it by running the script ``real_time_plot.py`` (located under :file:`scripts/profiler`).
As arguments, pass the csv and json file names that should be used to store the data (for example, run ``real_time_plot.py data.csv data.json``).

The script opens a GUI window that displays events as points on timelines.
See the Profiler documentation for more information.

Connect to the board with a terminal emulator (for example, PuTTY) to see messages displayed by the sample.
See :ref:`putty` for the required settings.


Dependencies
************

This sample uses the following |NCS| subsystems:

* :ref:`profiler`
