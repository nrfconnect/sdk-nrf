	  Set the SoC output power and the front-end module gain to achieve the Tx output power
	  requested by user. If the exact value cannot be achieved, power is set to the closest
	  possible value. If this option is disabled, user can set the SoC output power and the
	  front-end module gain with the separate vendor specific commands.
