	help
	  Sets Radio interrupt priority.
	  Levels are from 0 (highest priority) to 6 (lowest priority)

	  Sets DTM timer interrupt priority.
	  Levels are from 0 (highest priority) to 6 (lowest priority)

config DTM_USB
	bool "DTM over USB CDC ACM class"
	depends on SOC_NRF5340_CPUNET
	select EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Use USB instead of UART as the DTM interface. For nRF5340 the USB from application core
	  is used as communication interface.

config DTM_POWER_CONTROL_AUTOMATIC
	bool "Automatic power control"
	depends on FEM
	default y
	help
	  Set the SoC output power and the front-end module gain to achieve the Tx output power
	  requested by user. If the exact value cannot be achieved, power is set to the closest
	  possible value. If this option is disabled, user can set the SoC output power and the
	  front-end module gain with the separate vendor specific commands.
