   :depth: 2

The Peripheral Memfault Diagnostic Service sample demonstrates how to use the :ref:`mds_readme` with the `Memfault SDK`_ in an |NCS| Bluetooth application to collect core dumps and metrics.
The Memfault diagnostic data is sent through a Bluetooth gateway.

To get started with Memfault integration in |NCS|, see :ref:`ug_memfault`.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

.. include:: /includes/hci_ipc_overlay.txt

Overview
********

In this sample, the Memfault SDK is used as a module in the |NCS| to collect core dumps, reboot reasons, metrics, and trace events from devices and send them through a Bluetooth gateway to the Memfault cloud.
See `Memfault terminology`_ for more details on the various Memfault concepts.
The sample also includes the BAS functionalities.

Metrics
=======

The sample shows how to capture user-specific metrics.
It defines the following metrics:

* ``button_3_press_count`` - The number of **Button 3** presses.
* ``battery_soc_pct`` - The simulated battery level.
* ``button_1_elapsed_time_ms`` - The time measured between two **Button 1** presses.

These metrics are defined in the :file:`samples/bluetooth/peripheral_mds/memfault_config/memfault_metrics_heartbeat_config.def` file.
For more details about the metrics, see `Memfault: Collecting Device Metrics`_.

There are also metrics that are specific to |NCS|.
:ref:`mod_memfault` adds these system proprietary metrics.
The following metrics are enabled by default in this sample:

* Bluetooth metrics, enabled and disabled using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_BT_METRICS` Kconfig option.

  * ``ncs_bt_connection_count`` - Number of Bluetooth connections.
  * ``ncs_bt_connection_time_ms`` - Bluetooth connection time.

    Time with at least one live Bluetooth connection.
  * ``ncs_bt_bond_count`` - Number of Bluetooth bonds.

* Stack usage metrics shows the free stack space in bytes.
  Configurable by the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_STACK_METRICS` Kconfig option.

  * ``ncs_bt_rx_unused_stack`` - HCI RX thread stack.
  * ``ncs_bt_tx_unused_stack`` - HCI TX thread stack.

Error tracking with trace events
================================

The sample implements the following user-defined trace reason for demonstration purposes:

``button_2_state_changed`` - Collected every time when **Button 2** changes its state.

The trace events are defined in the file :file:`samples/bluetooth/peripheral_mds/memfault_config/memfault_trace_reason_user_config.def` file.
See `Memfault: Error Tracking with Trace Events`_ for more details about trace events.

Core dumps
==========

You can trigger core dumps in this sample using the following methods:

   * **Button 4** - Triggers a hardfault exception by division by zero.
   * ``mfl crash`` shell command - Triggers an assertion fail.

When a fault occurs, it results in crashes that are captured by Memfault.
After your development kit reboots and reconnects with the Bluetooth gateway, it sends core dump data to the Memfault cloud for further inspection and analysis.

Memfault shell
==============

The Bluetooth MDS sample enables a shell interface by default.
You can use it instead of the development kit buttons to trigger a separate event.

For a list of available commands, see `Memfault Demo CLI`_.

.. _peripheral_mds_user_interface:

User interface
**************

The sample supports a simple user interface.
You can control the sample using predefined buttons, while LEDs are used to display information.

LED 1:
   Blinks, toggling on/off every second, when the main loop is running and the device is advertising.

LED 2:
   Lit when the development kit is connected.

Button 1:
   Press this button to start time measuring.
   The second press stops time measuring.

   During the pairing procedure, press this button to accept pairing.

Button 2:
   Triggers the ``button_2_state_changed`` trace event.

   During the pairing procedure, press this button to reject pairing.

Button 3:
   Every press of this button is counted under the ``button_3_press_count`` metric.

Button 4:
   Simulate a development kit crash by triggering a hardfault exception by division by zero.


Configuration
*************

|config|

The Memfault SDK allows configuring some of its options using Kconfig.
For the options not configurable using Kconfig, use the :file:`samples/bluetooth/peripheral_mds/memfault_config/memfault_platform_config.h` file.
See `Memfault SDK`_ for more information.

To send data to the Memfault cloud through a Bluetooth gateway, you must configure a project key using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_PROJECT_KEY` Kconfig option.
You can find your project key in the project settings at `Memfault Dashboards`_.
You also need to set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_DEVICE_ID` static Kconfig option for this sample

Testing with nRF Memfault mobile applications
---------------------------------------------

You can use the `nRF Memfault for Android`_ or the `nRF Memfault for iOS`_ applications for testing the :ref:`mds_readme`.
You can also use them for your custom applications using the Memfault Diagnostic Service.

1. |connect_terminal_ANSI|
#. Reset your development kit.
#. Observe that the sample starts.
#. On your mobile phone with access to the Internet, open the nRF Memfault application.
#. In the mobile application, tap the :guilabel:`Start` button.
#. Look for your device running the Memfault Diagnostic Service in the :guilabel:`Discovered devices` list.
#. Select your device from the list.
#. Tap :guilabel:`Connect` button to connect with your development kit.
#. Wait for the application to establish connection with your development kit.

   In the mobile application, observe that Memfault chunks are forwarded from your device to the Memfault Cloud.
#. Return to the terminal and press Tab to confirm that the Memfault shell is working.
   The shell commands available are displayed.

   To learn about the Memfault shell commands, issue command ``mflt help``.
#. Use the buttons to trigger Memfault crashes, traces and metrics collection.
