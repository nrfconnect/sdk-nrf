Bluetooth: Central HIDS
#######################

The Central HIDS sample demonstrates how to use the :ref:`hids_c_readme` to interact with a HIDS server.
Basically, the sample simulates a computer that connects to a mouse or a keyboard.

Overview
********

The sample scans available devices, searching for a HIDS server.
If any HIDS server is found, the sample connects to it and discovers all characteristics.

If any input reports are detected, the sample subscribes to them to receive notifications.
If any boot reports are detected, the behavior depends on if they are boot mouse reports or boot keyboard reports:

* If a boot mouse report is detected, the sample subscribes to it.
* If a boot keyboard report is detected, the sample subscribes to its input report, and the sample functionality of changing the CAPSLOCK LED is enabled (Button 1 and 3).


Requirements
************

* One of the following development boards:

  * nRF9160 DK board (PCA10090)
  * nRF52840 Development Kit board (PCA10056)
  * nRF52 Development Kit board (PCA10040)
  * nRF51 Development Kit board (PCA10028)

* HIDS device to connect with (for example, another board running the :ref:`peripheral_hids_mouse` or :ref:`peripheral_hids_keyboard` sample, or a Bluetooth Low Energy dongle and nRF Connect for Desktop)


User interface
**************

Button 1:
   Toggle the CAPSLOCK LED on the connected keyboard using Write without response.
   This function is available only if the connected keyboard is set to work in Boot Protocol Mode.

Button 2:
   Switch between Boot Protocol Mode and Report Protocol Mode.
   This function is available only if the connected peer supports the Protocol Mode Characteristic.

Button 3:
   Toggle the CAPSLOCK LED on the connected keyboard using Write with response.
   This function is available only if the connected HID has boot keyboard reports.
   It always writes CAPSLOCK information to the boot report, even if Report Protocol Mode is selected.

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your board, you can test it either by connecting to another board that is running the :ref:`peripheral_hids_keyboard` sample, or by using `nRF Connect for Desktop`_ that emulates a HIDS server.


Testing with another board
--------------------------

1. |connect_terminal_specific|
#. Reset the board.
#. Program the other board with the :ref:`peripheral_hids_keyboard` sample and reset it.
#. Wait until the HIDS keyboard is detected by the central.
   All detected descriptors are listed.
   In the terminal window, check for information similar to the following::

      HIDS is ready to work
      Subscribe to report id: 1
      Subscribe to boot keyboard report

#. Press Button 1 and Button 2 on the board that runs the keyboard sample and observe the notification values in the terminal window.
   See :ref:`peripheral_hids_keyboard` for the expected values::

      Notification, id: 1, size: 8, data: 0x0 0x0 0xb 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0
      Notification, id: 1, size: 8, data: 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0

#. Press Button 2 on the board that runs the Central HIDS sample and observe that the protocol mode is updated into boot mode::

      Setting protocol mode: BOOT

#. Press Button 1 and Button 2 on the board that runs the keyboard sample and observe the notification of the boot report values::

      Notification, keyboard boot, size: 8, data: 0x0 0x0 0xf 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0
      Notification, keyboard boot, size: 8, data: 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0


#. Press Button 1 and Button 3 on the Central HIDS board and observe that LED 1 on the keyboard board changes its state.
   The information is also displayed in the terminal window::

      Caps lock send (val: 0x2)

      Caps lock send using write with response (val: 0x2)
      Capslock write result: 0
      Received data (size: 1, data[0]: 0x2)


Testing with nRF Connect for Desktop
------------------------------------

1. |connect_terminal_specific|
#. Reset the board.
#. Start `nRF Connect for Desktop`_ and select the connected dongle that is used for communication.
#. Go to the **Server setup** tab.
   Click the dongle configuration and select **Load setup**.
   Load the ``hids_keyboard.ncs`` file that is located under :file:`samples/bluetooth/central_hids` in the |NCS| folder structure.
#. Click **Apply to device**.
#. Go to the **Connection Map** tab.
   Click the dongle configuration and select **Advertising setup**.

   The current version of nRF Connect cannot store the advertising setup, so it must be configured manually.
   See the following image for the required target configuration:

   .. figure:: /images/bt_central_hids_nrfc_ad.png
      :alt: Advertising setup for HIDS keyboard simulator

   Advertising setup for HIDS keyboard simulator

   Complete the following steps to configure the advertising setup:

   a. Delete the default **Complete local name** from **Advertising data**.
   #. Add a **Custom AD type** with **AD type value** set to ``19`` and **Value** set to ``03c1``.
      This is the GAP Appearance advertising data.
   #. Add a **Custom AD type** with **AD type value** set to ``01`` and **Value** set to ``06``.
      This is the AD data with "General Discoverable" and "BR/EDR not supported" flags set.
   #. Add a **UUID 16 bit complete list** with two comma-separated values: ``1812`` and ``180F``.
      These are the values for HIDS and BAS.
   #. Add a **Complete local name** of your choice to the **Scan response data**.
   #. Click **Apply** and **Close**.

#. In the Adapter settings, choose **Start advertising**.
#. Wait until the board that runs the Central HIDS sample connects.
   All detected descriptors are listed.
   Check for information similar to the following::

      HIDS is ready to work
      Subscribe in report id: 1
      Subscribe in boot keyboard report

#. Explore the first record inside **Human Interface Device** (the one with six values).
   Change any of the values and note that the board logs the change.
#. Press Button 2 on the board and observe that the **Protocol Mode** value changes from ``01`` to ``00``.
#. Press Button 1 and Button 3 and observe that the **Boot Keyboard Output Report** value toggles between ``00`` and ``02``.
