The BluetoothÂ® Connection Subrating sample showcases the effect of the LE Connection Subrating feature on the duty cycle of a connection.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

You can use any combination of the development kits mentioned above in your testing setup.

Additionally, the sample requires a connection to a computer with a serial terminal for each of the development kits.

Overview
********

This sample transmits data in bursts between two development kits to measure the transmission latency using different subrating parameters.

Subrating provides a mechanism for indicating that only a specific subset of connection events will be actively used by the connected devices, with the radio not being used in other connection events.
Connection events are actively used when the peripheral listens for the event or sends data in the event.
A subrated connection can therefore have a short ACL connection interval but still exhibit a low duty cycle so that power is conserved.

When a higher bandwidth is needed, the subrate request procedure allows for connection parameter updates to be made with minimal delay.

To measure the transmission latency from application layers, a GATT Latency service `BT_UUID_LATENCY` is included to compute the time spent.
When the sender writes its timestamp to the `BT_UUID_LATENC_CHAR` characteristic of the receiver, the Latency service of the receiver will automatically reply back.
Whenever the sender receives a response, it will use its current time and the corresponding timestamp written before to estimate the round-trip time (RTT) of a writing characteristic procedure (see `Bluetooth Core Specification`_: Vol 3, Part F, 3.4.5 Writing attributes).

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to both development kits, test it by performing the following steps:

1. Connect to both kits with a terminal emulator (for example, `nRF Connect Serial Terminal`_).
   See :ref:`test_and_optimize` for the required settings and steps.
#. Reset both kits.
#. In one of the terminal emulators, type ``c`` to start the application on the connected board in the central role.
#. In the other terminal emulator, type ``p`` to start the application in the peripheral role.
#. Observe that the kits establish a connection.
#. The sample will alternate between the following configurations:

   * No subrating
   * Subrating with a factor of 10, continuation number 0
   * Subrating with a factor of 10, continuation number 1
#. Observe the difference in the duty cycle of the connection:

   * With no subrating, the link will always use a fast connection interval of 10ms.
   * With a subrate factor of 10 and no continuation events, the link will always use a slower effective connection interval of 100ms.
   * With a subrate factor of 10 and one continuation event, the link will use a fast connection interval of 10ms when data needs to be sent, and switch to a low effective connection interval of 100ms otherwise.

The sample demonstrates the ability for the peripheral to request changes to the subrating parameters.
This behavior can be changed by setting `#define SUBRATE_INITIATOR_ROLE` to `BT_CONN_ROLE_CENTRAL` in the sample.

The result should look similar to the following output:
