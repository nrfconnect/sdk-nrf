Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, you can test it either by connecting to an iOS device or by using `nRF Connect for Desktop`_ that emulates an ANCS Server.

Testing with an iOS device
--------------------------

#. |connect_terminal_specific|
#. Reset the kit.
#. Select the device in the iOS settings Bluetooth menu and connect.
#. Observe that notifications that are displayed in the iOS notification tab also show up on the UART from the sample.
#. Press **Button 1** to retrieve the notification attributes and observe that you receive, among other information, the app identifier for the last received notification.
   For example, if you got a notification from the Calendar app and request the app identifier, it is "com.apple.mobilecal".
#. Press **Button 2** to retrieve the app attributes and observe that you receive the display name for the app identifier from the previous step.
   For example, requesting the app attributes for "com.apple.mobilecal" yields "Calendar".
#. If the notification has a flag for a positive or negative action, perform the notification action with **Button 3** or **Button 4**, respectively.

Testing with nRF Connect for Desktop
------------------------------------

#. |connect_terminal_specific|
#. Reset the kit.
#. Start `nRF Connect for Desktop`_.
#. Open the Bluetooth Low Energy app and select the connected dongle that is used for communication.
#. Click the :guilabel:`SERVER SETUP` tab.
   Click the dongle configuration and select :guilabel:`Load setup`.
   Load the :file:`ANCS_central.ncs` file that is located under :file:`samples/bluetooth/peripheral_ancs_client` in the |NCS| folder structure.
#. Click :guilabel:`Apply to device`.
#. Click the :guilabel:`CONNECTION MAP` tab.
   Click the dongle configuration and select :guilabel:`Security parameters`.
   Check :guilabel:`Perform Bonding`, and click :guilabel:`Apply`.
#. Connect to the device from nRF Connect. The device is advertising as "ANCS".
#. Wait until the bond is established. Verify that the UART data is received as follows::

      Connected xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx (random)
      Security changed: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx (random) level 2
      Pairing completed: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx (random), bonded: 1
      GATT Service could not be found during the discovery
      The discovery procedure for ANCS succeeded

#. After bonding, verify in the Bluetooth Low Energy app that the **Client Characteristic Configuration** (CCCD) value for **Apple Notification Source** and **Apple Data Source** are set to ``01 00``.

Send an iOS notification to the application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following table shows the format of a notification that you can send to the example application:

   | Notification UID | 01 02 03 04   | 67305985 (0x4030201)     |
   +------------------+---------------+--------------------------+

#. In the Bluetooth Low Energy app, set the value of **Apple Notification Source** to ``00 18 06 02 01 02 03 04`` and click :guilabel:`Update`.
#. Verify that the UART data is received as follows::

      Notification
      Event:       Added
      Category ID: Email
      Category Cnt:2
      UID:         67305985
      Flags:
       Positive Action
       Negative Action

Perform a notification action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The received notification has two flags: Positive Action and Negative Action.
This means that you can perform these two actions on the notification.

The following table shows the format of the message that the application must send back to perform a notification action:

   +------------------+---------------+-----------------------------+
   | Field            | Example value | Interpretation              |
