The Automated power control sample demonstrates how to monitor the BluetoothÂ® LE signal strength (RSSI) and dynamically adjust the transmit (TX) power of a connected Peripheral device.
The Central collects RSSI data and sends power control commands to optimize the connection quality, which in turn optimizes the current consumption.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

You must use two compatible development kits to run this sample, one programmed with the Central application and one with the Peripheral application.

Overview
********

This sample illustrates Bluetooth LE power control by having the Central read the RSSI of an active connection and use it to adjust the Peripheral's transmit power.
The Central directly invokes SoftDevice Controller (SDC) APIs to configure power control behavior based on RSSI measurements.
This approach only works on single-core platforms where the Bluetooth Controller and application run on the same core.

There are two ways to monitor the connection parameters:

* Terminal output - Connects to the Central device's VCOM port (for example, ``VCOM1``) to view RSSI and TX power logs in real time.
* Graphical plotting - Uses the provided script to visualize signal strength over time:

	 .. code-block:: console

			python3 tools/plot_path_loss.py --comport COMPORT

.. note::

	 Make sure no terminal is open on the same serial port when using the Python plotting script, as it requires exclusive access.
	 Example of COM port - ``/dev/ttyACM1``.

This sample works only on single-core SoCs because it directly calls ``sdc_*`` functions (such as :c:func:`sdc_hci_cmd_vs_set_power_control_request_params`) that are only accessible on the core running the Bluetooth Controller.
On dual-core platforms such as nRF5340 or nRF54H20, the Bluetooth Controller runs on the network core, making these calls inaccessible from the application core and resulting in linker errors.

Workaround for dual-core SoCs
=============================

To adapt this sample for dual-core SoCs:

* Remove all ``sdc_*`` function calls from the application.
* Use Zephyr HCI commands to interface with the controller:

	 .. code-block:: c

			struct net_buf *buf = bt_hci_cmd_create(...);
			bt_hci_cmd_send_sync(...);

Refer to the :zephyr:code-sample:`bluetooth_hci_pwr_ctrl` sample or Nordic DevZone for reference implementations.

User interface
**************

Central:

* VCOM output displays live RSSI and TX power data.
* Optional plotting provides a visual graph of signal variation over time.

Peripheral:

* No direct user interface.
* Automatically accepts connections and responds to TX power control commands.

Configuration
*************

|config|

Configuration options
=====================

Check and configure the following Kconfig options:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CENTRAL` - Enables the Bluetooth LE Central role for the Central application.
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_PERIPHERAL` - Enables the Bluetooth LE Peripheral role for the Peripheral application.
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_DEVICE_NAME` - Sets the advertised name of the Peripheral (default: ``power_control_peripheral``).
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SCAN` - Enables scanning for Bluetooth LE advertisements (Central only).
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SCAN_FILTER_ENABLE` - Enables name-based filtering for Bluetooth scan results (Central only).
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_CONN_RSSI` - Enables controller-side RSSI reporting for active connections.
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_TRANSMIT_POWER_CONTROL` - Enables support for Bluetooth LE transmit power control.
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_PWR_DYNAMIC_CONTROL` - Allows dynamic adjustment of transmit power based on RSSI feedback.
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_HCI_RAW` - Enables raw HCI interface for communication between the application and controller cores (used in IPC radio configurations).
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOG` - Enables logging through Zephyr's logging subsystem (optional but useful for debugging).

Testing
=======

|test_sample|

1. Program one DK with the Peripheral Power Control firmware.
#. Program another DK with the Central Power Control firmware.
#. Open a terminal on the Central's VCOM port or run the plotting script.
#. Power on both devices.
#. The Central will scan and connect to the Peripheral automatically.
#. Observe RSSI and TX power data printed or plotted.
#. Move the devices or add obstructions to see dynamic power adjustment.

Sample output

The following output is logged from the Central device:
