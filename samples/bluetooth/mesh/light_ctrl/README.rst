The Bluetooth mesh light fixture sample demonstrates how to set up a light control mesh server model application, and control a dimmable LED with Bluetooth mesh using the :ref:`bt_mesh_onoff_readme`.

Overview
********

This sample is split into three source files:

* A :file:`main.c` file to handle initialization.
* A file for handling mesh models, :file:`model_handler.c`.
* A file for handling PWM driven control of the dimmable LED, :file:`lc_pwm_led.c`.

After provisioning and configuring the mesh models supported by the sample in the `nRF Mesh mobile app`_, you can control the dimmable LED on the development kit from the app.

Provisioning
============

The provisioning is handled by the :ref:`bt_mesh_dk_prov`.

Models
======

The following table shows the mesh light fixture composition data for this sample:

   +-------------------------------+----------------------------+
   | Gen. Power OnOff Setup Server |                            |
   +-------------------------------+----------------------------+
   | Light Lightness Server        |                            |
   +-------------------------------+----------------------------+
   | Light Lightness Setup Server  |                            |
   +-------------------------------+----------------------------+

The models are used for the following purposes:

- The first element contains a Config Server and a Health Server.
  The Config Server allows configurator devices to configure the node remotely.
  The Health Server provides ``attention`` callbacks that are used during provisioning to call your attention to the device.
  These callbacks trigger blinking of the LEDs.
- The seven other models in the first element are the product of a single instance of the Light Lightness Server.
  The application implements callbacks for the Light Lightness Server to control the first LED on the device using the PWM (pulse width modulation) driver.
- The three models in the second element are the product of a single instance of the Light Lightness Control (LC) Server.
  The Light LC Server controls the Light Lightness Server in the first element, deciding on parameters such as fade time, lighting levels for different states, and inactivity timing.
  In this sample, the Light LC Server is enabled by default on startup.

Other nodes can control the Light Lightness Server through the Light LC Server, by sending On/Off messages to the Light LC Server or to the Generic OnOff Server in the second element.

.. note::
   It is possible to bypass the Light LC Server by directly communicating with the Light Lightness Server on the first element.

For more details, see :ref:`bt_mesh_lightness_srv_readme` and :ref:`bt_mesh_light_ctrl_srv_readme`.

The model handling is implemented in :file:`src/model_handler.c`, which uses the :ref:`dk_buttons_and_leds_readme` library and the :ref:`zephyr:pwm_api` API to control the LEDs on the development kit.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf52840dk_nrf52840, nrf52dk_nrf52832

The sample also requires a smartphone with Nordic Semiconductor's nRF Mesh mobile app installed in one of the following versions:

  * `nRF Mesh mobile app for Android`_
  * `nRF Mesh mobile app for iOS`_

User interface
**************

Buttons:
   Can be used to input the out-of-band (OOB) authentication value during provisioning.
   All buttons have the same functionality during this procedure.

LEDs:
   Show the OOB authentication value during provisioning if the "Push button" OOB method is used.
   First LED outputs the current light level of the Light Lightness Server in the first element.


Building and running

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, you can test it by using a smartphone with Nordic Semiconductor's nRF Mesh app installed.
Testing consists of provisioning the device and configuring it for communication with the mesh models.

Provisioning the device
-----------------------

.. |device name| replace:: :guilabel:`Mesh Light Fixture`

.. include:: /includes/mesh_device_provisioning.txt

Configuring models
------------------

See :ref:`ug_bt_mesh_model_config_app` for details on how to configure the mesh models with the nRF Mesh mobile app.

Configure the Generic OnOff Client model on each element on the :guilabel:`Mesh Light Fixture` node:

* Bind the model to :guilabel:`Application Key 1`.

  Once the model is bound to the application key, you can control the first LED on the device.
* In the model view, tap :guilabel:`ON` (one of the Generic On Off Controls) to light up the first LED on the development kit.

You should now see the following actions:

1. The LED fades from 0% to 100% over 500ms :guilabel:`Standby -> On`.
#. The LED stays at 100% for three seconds :guilabel:`On`.
#. The LED fades from 100% to 50% over five seconds :guilabel:`On -> Prolong`.
#. The LED stays at 50% for three seconds :guilabel:`Prolong`.
#. The LED fades from 50% to 0% over five seconds :guilabel:`Prolong -> Standby`.

.. note::
   The configuration of light levels, fade time, and timeouts can be changed by altering the configuration parameters in the :file:`prj.conf` file, and rebuilding the sample.
