Bluetooth: Mesh Light
#####################

The Bluetooth Mesh Light sample demonstrates how to set up a basic Mesh server model application and control LEDs with the Bluetooth Mesh, using the :ref:`bt_mesh_onoff_readme`.

.. note::
    This sample is self-contained and can be tested on its own.
    However, it is required when testing the the :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_light_switch` sample.

Overview
********

This sample is split into two source files:

* A :file:`main.c` file to handle initialization.
* One additional file for handling Mesh models, :file:`model_handler.c`.

After provisioning and configuring the Mesh models supported by the sample in the `nRF Mesh mobile app`_, you can control the LEDs on the development kit from the app.

Provisioning
============

The provisioning is handled by the :ref:`bt_mesh_dk_prov`.

Models
======

The following table shows the Mesh light composition data for this sample:

.. table::
   :align: center

   =================  =================  =================  =================
   Element 1          Element 2          Element 3          Element 4
   =================  =================  =================  =================
   Config Server      Gen. OnOff Server  Gen. OnOff Server  Gen. OnOff Server
   Health Server
   Gen. OnOff Server
   =================  =================  =================  =================

The models are used for the following purposes:

* :ref:`bt_mesh_onoff_srv_readme` instances in elements 1 to 4 each control LEDs 1 to 4, respectively.
* Config Server allows configurator devices to configure the node remotely.
* Health Server provides ``attention`` callbacks that are used during provisioning to call your attention to the device.
  These callbacks trigger blinking of the LEDs.

The model handling is implemented in :file:`src/model_handler.c`, which uses the :ref:`dk_buttons_and_leds_readme` to control each LED on the board according to the matching received messages of Generic OnOff Server.

Requirements
************

* One of the following development kits:

  * |nRF5340DK|; if you use this development kit, add the following options to the configuration of the network sample:

    .. code-block:: none

        CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_BUFFER_SIZE=74
        CONFIG_BT_CTLR_DATA_LENGTH_MAX=74

    This is required because Bluetooth Mesh has different |BLE| Controller requirements than other Bluetooth samples.

  * |nRF52840DK|
  * |nRF52DK|
  * |nRF51DK|

* Smartphone with Nordic Semiconductor's nRF Mesh mobile app installed in one of the following versions:

  * `nRF Mesh mobile app for Android`_
  * `nRF Mesh mobile app for iOS`_

User interface
**************

Buttons:
   Can be used to input the OOB authentication value during provisioning.
   All buttons have the same functionality during this procedure.

LEDs:
   Show the OOB authentication value during provisioning if the "Push button" OOB method is used.
   Show the OnOff state of the Generic OnOff server of the corresponding element.

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your board, you can test it by using a smartphone with Nordic Semiconductor's nRF Mesh app installed.
Testing consists of provisioning the device and configuring it for communication with the mesh models.

Provisioning the device
-----------------------

The provisioning assigns an address range to the device, and adds it to the mesh network.
Complete the following steps in the nRF Mesh app:

1. Tap :guilabel:`Add node` to start scanning for unprovisioned mesh devices.
#. Select the :guilabel:`Mesh Light` device to connect to it.
#. Tap :guilabel:`Identify` and then :guilabel:`Provision` to provision the device.
#. When prompted, select the OOB method and follow the instructions in the app.

Once the provisioning is complete, the app returns to the Network screen.

Configuring models
------------------

Complete the following steps in the nRF Mesh app to configure models:

1. On the Network screen, tap the :guilabel:`Mesh Light` node.
   Basic information about the mesh node and its configuration is displayed.
#. In the Mesh node view, expand the first element.
   It contains the list of models in the first element of the node.
#. Tap :guilabel:`Generic OnOff Server` to see the model's configuration.
#. Bind the model to application keys to make it open for communication:

   1. Tap :guilabel:`BIND KEY` at the top of the screen.
   #. Select :guilabel:`Application Key 1` from the list.

   You are now able to control the first LED on the device by using the Generic On Off Controls in the model view.
#. Tap :guilabel:`ON` to light up the first LED on the development kit.

Repeat steps 3-5 for each of the elements on the node to enable controling each of the remaining three LEDs.
