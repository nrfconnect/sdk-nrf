The peripheral LBS sample demonstrates how to use the :ref:`lbs_readme`.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

The sample also requires a smartphone or tablet running a compatible mobile application.
The `Testing`_ instructions refer to `nRF Connect for Mobile`_, but you can also use other similar applications (for example, `nRF Blinky`_ or `nRF Toolbox`_).

Overview
********

You can use the sample to transmit the button state from your development kit to another device.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF52 and nRF53 DKs

      When connected, the sample sends the state of **Button 1** on the development kit to the connected device, such as a phone or tablet.
      The mobile application on the device can display the received button state and control the state of **LED 3** on the development kit.

   .. group-tab:: nRF54 DKs

      When connected, the sample sends the state of **Button 0** on the development kit to the connected device, such as a phone or tablet.
      The mobile application on the device can display the received button state and control the state of **LED 2** on the development kit.

You can also use this sample to control the color of the RGB LED on the nRF52840 Dongle or Thingy:53.

User interface
**************

The user interface of the sample depends on the hardware platform you are using.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF52 and nRF53 DKs

      LED 1:
         Blinks when the main loop is running (that is, the device is advertising) with a period of two seconds, duty cycle 50%.

      LED 2:
         Lit when the development kit is connected.

      LED 3:
         Lit when the development kit is controlled remotely from the connected device.

      Button 1:
         Send a notification with the button state: "pressed" or "released".

   .. group-tab:: nRF54 DKs

      LED 0:
         Blinks when the main loop is running (that is, the device is advertising) with a period of two seconds, duty cycle 50%.

      LED 1:
         Lit when the development kit is connected.

      LED 2:
         Lit when the development kit is controlled remotely from the connected device.

      Button 0:
         Send a notification with the button state: "pressed" or "released".

   .. group-tab:: Thingy:53

      RGB LED:
         The RGB LED channels are used independently to display the following information:

         * Red - If the main loop is running (that is, the device is advertising).
           The LED blinks with a period of two seconds, duty cycle 50%.
         * Green - If the device is connected.
         * Blue - If user set the LED using Nordic LED Button Service.

         For example, if Thingy:53 is connected over Bluetooth, the LED color toggles between green and yellow.
         The green LED channel is kept on and the red LED channel is blinking.

      Button 1:
         Send a notification with the button state: "pressed" or "released".

   .. group-tab:: nRF52840 Dongle

      Green LED:
         Blinks, toggling on/off every second, when the main loop is running and the device is advertising.

      RGB LED:
         The RGB LED channels are used independently to display the following information:

         * Red - If Dongle is connected.
         * Green - If user set the LED using Nordic LED Button Service.

      Button 1:
         Send a notification with the button state: "pressed" or "released".

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/bluetooth/peripheral_lbs`

.. include:: /includes/nRF54H20_erase_UICR.txt

Minimal build
=============

You can build the sample with a minimum configuration as a demonstration of how to reduce code size and RAM usage, using the ``-DFILE_SUFFIX=minimal`` flag in your build.

See :ref:`cmake_options` for instructions on how to add this option to your build.
For example, when building on the command line, you can add the option as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   west build samples/bluetooth/peripheral_lbs -- -DFILE_SUFFIX=minimal

.. _peripheral_lbs_testing:

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your dongle or development kit, one of the LEDs starts blinking to indicate that the advertising loop is active (see `User interface`_ for details).

To test the sample using the `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ application, complete the following steps:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF52 and nRF53 DKs

      1. Install and start the `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ application on your smartphone or tablet.
      #. Power on the development kit or insert your dongle into the USB port.
      #. Connect to the device from the application.
         The device is advertising as ``Nordic_LBS``.
         The services of the connected device are shown.
      #. In **Nordic LED Button Service**, enable notifications for the **Button** characteristic.
      #. Press **Button 1** on the device.
      #. Observe that notifications with the following values are displayed:

         * ``Button released`` when **Button 1** is released.
         * ``Button pressed`` when **Button 1** is pressed.

      #. Write the following values to the LED characteristic in the **Nordic LED Button Service**.
         Depending on the hardware platform, this produces results described in the table.

         +------------------------+---------+----------------------------------------------+
         | Hardware platform      | Value   | Effect                                       |
