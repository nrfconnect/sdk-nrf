The Peripheral AMS client sample demonstrates how to use the :ref:`ams_client_readme`.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

The sample also requires a device running an AMS Server to connect with (for example, an iPhone, or a computer with a BluetoothÂ® Low Energy dongle and nRF Connect for Desktop).

Overview
********

The AMS client sample serves a Media Remote (MR).
It can interact with a Media Source (MS), typically an iPhone or some other Apple device.

The sample prints the media details received from the MS on the UART.
It can request the MS to perform certain actions, such as starting playback and jumping to next track.

User interface
**************

LED 1:
   Blinks, toggling on/off every second, when the main loop is running and the device is advertising.

LED 2:
   Lit when connected.

Button 1:
   Enable and disable MS track attributes notification.

Button 2:
   Request MS to start or pause playback.

Button 3:
   Request MS to jump to the next track if it is supported.
   Otherwise, request MS to turn up the volume.

Button 4:
   Request MS to jump to the previous track if it is supported.
   Otherwise, request MS to turn down the volume.

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, you can test it either by connecting to an iOS device or by using the Bluetooth Low Energy app of `nRF Connect for Desktop`_ that emulates an AMS Server.

Testing with an iOS device
--------------------------

#. |connect_terminal_specific|
#. Reset the kit.
#. Select the device in the iOS :guilabel:`Settings` > :guilabel:`Bluetooth` menu > :guilabel:`Connect`.
   When requested, proceed with pairing.
#. Open the :guilabel:`Apple Music` app and bring up a playlist with some songs.
#. Press **Button 1** to enable song detail updates.
#. Press **Button 2** to play a song.
   Press again to pause playback.
#. Press **Button 3** to jump to the next song.
#. Press **Button 4** to jump to the previous song.

Testing with nRF Connect for Desktop
------------------------------------

#. |connect_terminal_specific|
#. Reset the kit.
#. Start the Bluetooth Low Energy app of `nRF Connect for Desktop`_ and select the connected dongle that is used for communication.
#. Set up the server:
   a. Select the **Server setup** tab.
   #. Select :guilabel:`Dongle configuration` > :guilabel:`Load setup`.
   #. Load the :file:`AMS_central.ncs` file located under :file:`samples/bluetooth/peripheral_ams_client` in the |NCS| folder structure.
#. Click :guilabel:`Apply to device`.
#. Select the :guilabel:`Connection Map` tab.
#. Select :guilabel:`Dongle configuration` > :guilabel:`Security parameters`.
#. Check :guilabel:`Perform Bonding`, and click :guilabel:`Apply`.
#. Connect to the device from the Bluetooth Low Energy app. The device is advertising as "Nordic_AMS".
#. Wait until the bond is established.
   Verify that the UART data is received as follows::

      Connected xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx (random)
      The discovery procedure succeeded
      Security changed: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx (random) level 2
      Pairing completed: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx (random), bonded: 1

#. After bonding, verify in the Bluetooth Low Energy app that the **Client Characteristic Configuration** (CCCD) value for **Apple Remote Command** and **Apple Entity Update** are set to ``01 00``.

Music setup
^^^^^^^^^^^

Complete the following steps to initiate a music player setup:

#. In the Bluetooth Low Energy app, verify that the **Apple Entity Update** is initiated to ``00 00 01 02``.
