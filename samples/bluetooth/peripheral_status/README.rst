The peripheral status sample demonstrates how to use the :ref:`nsms_readme` library.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

The sample also requires a smartphone or tablet running a compatible application.
The `Testing`_ instructions refer to `nRF Connect for Mobile`_, but you can also use other similar applications (for example, `nRF Toolbox`_).

Overview
********

The sample implements two NSMS instances that result in two NSMS characteristics that describe the status of two buttons (**Button 1** and **Button 2**).
Each characteristic has a name set in Characteristic User Description (CUD) that corresponds to the button whose status is shown.

Moreover, status related to **Button 2** has configurable security settings.
When :ref:`CONFIG_BT_STATUS_SECURITY_ENABLED <CONFIG_BT_STATUS_SECURITY_ENABLED>` is configured, the status related to **Button 2** has security enabled, thus it can be accessed only when bonded.

User interface
**************

The user interface of the sample depends on the hardware platform you are using.

Thingy:53
=========

RGB LED:
   The RGB LED channels are used independently to display the following information:

   * Red - If the main loop is running (that is, the device is advertising).
     Blinks with a period of two seconds with the duty cycle set to 50% when the main loop is running and the device is advertising.
   * Green - If the device is connected.

   For example, if Thingy:53 is connected over Bluetooth, the LED color toggles between green and yellow.
   The green LED channel is kept on, and the red LED channel is blinking.

Button 1:
   Set **Button 1** NSMS Status Characteristic to: "Pressed" or "Released".
   Notify the client if notification is enabled.

Button 2 (the one hidden under the cover):
   Set **Button 2** NSMS Status Characteristic to: "Pressed" or "Released".
   Notify the client if notification is enabled.
   By default, this service requires the connection to be secured to read or notify.

Development kits
================

LED 1:
   Blinks with a period of two seconds with the duty cycle set to 50% when the main loop is running and the device is advertising.

LED 2:
   Lit when the development kit is connected.

Button 1:
   Set **Button 1** NSMS Status Characteristic to: "Pressed" or "Released".
   Notify the client if notification is enabled.

Button 2 (the one hidden under the cover):
   Set **Button 2** NSMS Status Characteristic to: "Pressed" or "Released".
   Notify the client if notification is enabled.
   By default, this service requires the connection to be secured to read or notify.

Configuration
*************

|config|

Configuration options
=====================

Check and configure the following configuration options for the sample:

.. _CONFIG_BT_STATUS_SECURITY_ENABLED:

CONFIG_BT_STATUS_SECURITY_ENABLED - Enable Bluetooth® LE security
  This configuration enables Bluetooth® LE security implementation for Nordic Status Message instances.
  When you enable this option, one of the status messages will be displayed only when the connection is secure.

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/bluetooth/peripheral_lbs`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your dongle or development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

1. Start the `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ application on your smartphone or tablet.
#. Power on the development kit, or insert your dongle into the USB port.
#. Connect to the device from the application.
   The device is advertising as ``Nordic_Status``.
   The services of the connected device are shown.
#. Find **Nordic Status Message Service** by its UUID listed in :ref:`nsms_readme`.
#. Read its **Characteristic User Description** to check which button it relates to.
#. Read **Nordic Status Message Service** message characteristic to check the initial status - if no button was pressed, it should be "Unknown".
#. Enable notification for the characteristic found.
#. Press the related button and observe the message change between "Pressed" and "Released".

.. note::
   Performing the same for **Button 2** characteristic requires a secured connection.

Dependencies
************
