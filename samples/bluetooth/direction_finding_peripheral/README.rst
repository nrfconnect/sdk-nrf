The direction finding peripheral sample demonstrates BluetoothÂ® LE direction finding transmission as a response to a request received from a connected central device.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

The sample also requires an antenna matrix when operating in angle of departure mode.
It can be a Nordic Semiconductor design 12 patch antenna matrix, or any other antenna matrix.

Overview
********

The direction finding peripheral sample uses Constant Tone Extension (CTE), that is transmitted with periodic advertising PDUs.

The sample supports two direction finding modes:

* Angle of Arrival (AoA)
* Angle of Departure (AoD)

By default, both modes are available in the sample.

Configuration
*************

|config|

This sample configuration is split into the following two files:

* generic configuration is available in the :file:`prj.conf` file
* board specific configuration is available in the :file:`boards/<BOARD>.conf` file

nRF5340 configuration files
===========================

The following additional configuration files are available for the :ref:`nRF5340 DK <ug_nrf5340>`:

* The Bluetooth LE controller is part of a child image meant to run on the network core.
  The configuration for the child image is stored in the :file:`child_image/` subdirectory.
* :file:`boards/nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp.overlay` DTS overlay file is available for the application core.
  This file forwards the control over GPIOs to network core, which gives control over GPIOs to the radio peripheral in order to execute antenna switching.


Angle of arrival mode
=====================

To build this sample with angle of arrival mode only, set ``OVERLAY_CONFIG`` to :file:`overlay-aoa.conf`.

See :ref:`cmake_options` for instructions on how to add this option.
For more information about using configuration overlay files, see :ref:`zephyr:important-build-vars` in the Zephyr documentation.

To build this sample for :ref:`nRF5340 DK <ug_nrf5340>`, with angle of arrival mode only, add content of :file:`overlay-aoa.conf` file to :file:`child_image/hci_rpmsg.conf` file.

Antenna matrix configuration for angle of departure mode
========================================================

To use this sample when angle of departure mode is enabled, additional configuration of GPIOs is required to control the antenna array.
Example of such configuration is provided in a devicetree overlay file :file:`nrf52833dk_nrf52833.overlay`.

The overlay file provides the information about which GPIOs should be used by the Radio peripheral to switch between antenna patches during the CTE transmission in the AoD mode.
At least two GPIOs must be provided to enable antenna switching.

The GPIOs are used by the Radio peripheral in order given by the ``dfegpio#-gpios`` properties.
The order is important because it affects mapping of the antenna switching patterns to GPIOs (see `Antenna patterns`_).

To successfully use the direction finding beacon when the AoD mode is enabled, provide the following data related to antenna matrix design:

* Provide the GPIO pins to ``dfegpio#-gpios`` properties in :file:`nrf52833dk_nrf52833.overlay` file
* Provide the default antenna that will be used to transmit a PDU ``dfe-pdu-antenna`` property in the :file:`nrf52833dk_nrf52833.overlay` file
* Update the antenna switching patterns in :c:member:`ant_patterns` array in :file:`main.c`.

Antenna patterns
================

The antenna switching pattern is a binary number where each bit is applied to a particular antenna GPIO pin.
For example, the pattern 0x3 means that antenna GPIOs at index 0,1 will be set, while the following are left unset.

This also means that, for example, when using four GPIOs, the pattern count cannot be greater than 16 and maximum allowed value is 15.

If the number of switch-sample periods is greater than the number of stored switching patterns, then the radio loops back to the first pattern.

The length of the antenna switching pattern is limited by the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_DF_MAX_ANT_SW_PATTERN_LEN` option.
If the required length of the antenna switching pattern is greater than the default value of :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_DF_MAX_ANT_SW_PATTERN_LEN`, set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_DF_MAX_ANT_SW_PATTERN_LEN` option to the required value in the board configuration file.
For example, for the :ref:`nRF52833 DK <ug_nrf52>` add :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_DF_MAX_ANT_SW_PATTERN_LEN` =N, where N is the required antenna switching pattern length, to the :file:`nrf52833dk_nrf52833.conf` file.

The following table presents the patterns that you can use to switch antennas on the Nordic-designed antenna matrix:
