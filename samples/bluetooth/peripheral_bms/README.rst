The peripheral BMS sample demonstrates how to use the :ref:`bms_readme`.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

The sample also requires a BluetoothÂ® Low Energy dongle and nRF Connect for Desktop.

Overview
********

When connected, the sample waits for the client's requests to perform any bond-deleting operation.

It supports up to two simultaneous client connections.

User interface
**************

LED 1:
   Blinks, toggling on/off every second, when the main loop is running and the device is advertising.

LED 2:
   Lit when connected.

Testing
=======

|test_sample|

1. |connect_terminal_specific|
#. Reset the kit.
#. Start `nRF Connect for Desktop`_.
#. Open the Bluetooth Low Energy app and select the connected device that is used for communication.
#. Connect to the device from the app.
   The device is advertising as "Nordic_BMS".
#. Bind with the device:

   a. Click the :guilabel:`Settings` button for the device in the app.
   #. Select :guilabel:`Pair`.
   #. Select :guilabel:`Keyboard and display` in the IO capabilities setting.
   #. Select :guilabel:`Perform Bonding`.
   #. Click :guilabel:`Pair`.

#. Check the logs to verify that the connection security is updated.
#. Disconnect the device in nRF Connect.
#. Reconnect again and verify that the connection security is updated automatically.
#. Verify that the Feature Characteristic of the Bond Management Service displays ``10 08 02``.
   This means that the following features are supported:

   * Deletion of the bonds for the current connection of the requesting device.
   * Deletion of all bonds on the Server with the Authorization Code.
   * Deletion of all bonds on the Server except the ones of the requesting device with the Authorization Code.

#. Write ``03`` to the Bond Management Service Control Point Characteristic.
   ``03`` is the command to delete the current bond.
#. Disconnect the device to trigger the bond deletion procedures.
#. Reconnect the devices and verify that the connection security is not updated.
#. Bond both devices again.
#. Write ``06 41 42 43 44`` to the Bond Management Service Control Point Characteristic.
   ``06`` is the command to delete all bonds on the Server, followed by the authorization code "ABCD".
#. Disconnect the device to trigger the bond deletion procedures.
#. Reconnect the devices again and verify that the connection security is not updated.
