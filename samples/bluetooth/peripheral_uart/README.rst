The Peripheral UART sample demonstrates how to use the :ref:`nus_service_readme`.
It uses the NUS service to send data back and forth between a UART connection and a Bluetooth® LE connection, emulating a serial port over Bluetooth LE.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

.. note::
   * The boards ``nrf52dk/nrf52810``, ``nrf52840dk/nrf52811``, and ``nrf52833dk/nrf52820`` only support the `Minimal sample variant`_.
   * When used with :zephyr:board:`thingy53`, the sample supports the MCUboot bootloader with serial recovery and SMP DFU over Bluetooth.
     Thingy:53 has no built-in SEGGER chip, so the UART 0 peripheral is not gated to a USB CDC virtual serial port.
   * When used with :zephyr:board:`nrf5340dk`, the sample might support the MCUboot bootloader with serial recovery of the networking core image.

The sample also requires using a compatible application for `Testing`_.
You can use the `Bluetooth Low Energy app`_ for desktop or the `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ (or other similar applications, such as `nRF Blinky`_ or `nRF Toolbox`_).
Using mobile applications for testing requires a smartphone or tablet.

You can also test the application with the :ref:`central_uart` sample.
See the documentation for that sample for detailed instructions.

.. note::
   |thingy53_sample_note|

   The sample also enables an additional :ref:`USB CDC ACM class serial port <thingy53_app_usb>` that is used instead of UART 0.
   Because of that, it uses a separate USB Vendor and Product ID.

Overview
********

When connected, the sample forwards any data received on the RX pin of the UART 0 peripheral to the Bluetooth LE unit.
On Nordic Semiconductor's development kits, the UART 0 peripheral is typically gated through the SEGGER chip to a USB CDC virtual serial port.

Any data sent from the Bluetooth LE unit is sent out of the UART 0 peripheral's TX pin.

.. note::
   Thingy:53 uses the second instance of USB CDC ACM class instead of UART 0, because it has no built-in SEGGER chip that could be used to gate UART 0.

.. _peripheral_uart_debug:

Debugging
=========

In this sample, the UART console is used to send and read data over the NUS service.
Debug messages are not displayed in this UART console.
Instead, they are printed by the RTT logger.

If you want to view the debug messages, follow the procedure in :ref:`testing_rtt_connect`.

.. note::
   On the Thingy:53, debug logs are provided over the :ref:`USB CDC ACM class serial port <thingy53_app_usb>` instead of :ref:`RTT or other logging backends <ug_logging_backends>`.

For more information about debugging in the |NCS|, see :ref:`debugging`.

FEM support
***********

.. include:: /includes/sample_fem_support.txt

.. _peripheral_uart_minimal_ext:

Minimal sample variant
======================

You can build the sample with a minimum configuration as a demonstration of how to reduce code size and RAM usage.
This variant is available for resource-constrained boards.

See :ref:`peripheral_uart_sample_activating_variants` for details.

.. _peripheral_uart_cdc_acm_ext:

USB CDC ACM extension
=====================

For the boards with the USB device peripheral, you can build the sample with support for the USB CDC ACM class serial port instead of the physical UART.
This build uses the sample-specific UART async adapter module that acts as a bridge between USB CDC ACM and Zephyr's UART asynchronous API used by the sample.
See :ref:`peripheral_uart_sample_activating_variants` for details about how to build the sample with this extension using the :file:`prj_cdc.conf` file.

Async adapter experimental module
---------------------------------

The default sample configuration uses the UART async API.
The sample uses the :ref:`lib_uart_async_adapter` library to communicate with the USB CDC ACM driver.
This is needed because the USB CDC ACM implementation provides only the interrupt interface.

To use the library, set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_UART_ASYNC_ADAPTER` Kconfig option to ``y``.

MCUboot with serial recovery of the networking core image
=========================================================

For the ``nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp``, it is possible to enable serial recovery of the network core while multi-image update is not enabled in the MCUboot.
See :ref:`peripheral_uart_sample_activating_variants` for details on how to build the sample with this feature using the :file:`nrf5340dk_app_sr_net.conf` and :file:`nrf5340dk_mcuboot_sr_net.conf` files.

User interface
**************

The user interface of the sample depends on the hardware platform you are using.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF21, nRF52 and nRF53 DKs

      LED 1:
         Blinks, toggling on/off every second, when the main loop is running and the device is advertising.

      LED 2:
         Lit when connected.

      Button 1:
         Confirm the passkey value that is printed in the debug logs to pair/bond with the other device.

      Button 2:
         Reject the passkey value that is printed in the debug logs to prevent pairing/bonding with the other device.

   .. group-tab:: nRF54 DKs

      LED 0:
         Blinks, toggling on/off every second, when the main loop is running and the device is advertising.

      LED 1:
         Lit when connected.

      Button 0:
         Confirm the passkey value that is printed in the debug logs to pair/bond with the other device.

      Button 1:
         Reject the passkey value that is printed in the debug logs to prevent pairing/bonding with the other device.

   .. group-tab:: Thingy:53

      RGB LED:
         The RGB LED channels are used independently to display the following information:

         * Red channel blinks with a period of two seconds, duty cycle 50%, when the main loop is running (device is advertising).
         * Green channel displays if device is connected.

      Button:
         Confirm the passkey value that is printed in the debug logs to pair/bond with the other device.
         Thingy:53 has only one button, therefore the passkey value cannot be rejected by pressing a button.

               It appears in the **Value** field of **UART TX characteristic**.

               If the text does not appear, check if notifications are enabled for this characteristic.
               You can toggle the notification settings with a button in the lower right corner of **UART TX Characteristic**.

Testing with Bluetooth Low Energy app
-------------------------------------

If you have an nRF52 Series DK with the Peripheral UART sample and either a dongle or second Nordic Semiconductor development kit that supports the `Bluetooth Low Energy app`_, you can test the sample on your computer.
Use the `Bluetooth Low Energy app`_ in `nRF Connect for Desktop`_ for testing.

To perform the test, complete the following steps:

1. Install the `Bluetooth Low Energy app`_ in `nRF Connect for Desktop`_.
#. Connect to your nRF52 Series DK.
#. Connect the dongle or second development kit to a USB port of your computer.
#. Open the app.
#. Select the serial port that corresponds to the dongle or the second development kit.
   Do not select the kit you want to test just yet.

   .. note::
      If the dongle or the second development kit has not been used with the Bluetooth Low Energy app before, you may be asked to update the J-Link firmware and connectivity firmware on the nRF SoC to continue.
      When the nRF SoC has been updated with the correct firmware, the app finishes connecting to your device over USB.
      When the connection is established, the device appears in the main view.

#. Click :guilabel:`Start scan`.
#. Find the development kit you want to test and click the corresponding :guilabel:`Connect` button.

   The default name for the Peripheral UART sample is *Nordic_UART_Service*.

#. Select the **Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)** RX characteristic value.
#. Write ``30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39`` (the hexadecimal value for the string "0123456789") and click :guilabel:`Write`.

   The data is transmitted over Bluetooth LE from the app to the DK that runs the Peripheral UART sample.
   The terminal emulator connected to the development kit then displays ``"0123456789"``.

#. In the terminal emulator, enter any text, for example ``Hello``.

   The data is transmitted to the development kit that runs the Peripheral UART sample.
   The **UART TX** characteristic displayed in the app changes to the corresponding ASCII value.
   For example, the value for ``Hello`` is ``48 65 6C 6C 6F``.
