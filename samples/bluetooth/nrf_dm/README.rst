Bluetooth: nRF Distance Measurement with Bluetooth LE discovery
###############################################################

The nRF Distance Measurement sample demonstrates the functionality of the Distance Measurement (DM) subsystem.
It shows how to use DM to measure the distance between devices.
The BluetoothÂ® Direction and Distance Finding Service is running simultaneously.

Sample is configured to use Nordic's SoftDevice link layer.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

Overview
********

The sample initializes and performs distance measurements between devices.
The procedure for distance measurement on both devices must be synchronized.

The synchronisation step has two goals:

   * Detect peers that support the ranging procedure.
   * Provide synchronisation for the ranging step.

This sample synchronizes devices using the scan and advertising facilities of the Bluetooth LE.
Anchoring occurs after the exchange of ``SCAN_REQ`` and ``SCAN_RSP`` packets.

   :alt: Synchronisation process

   Synchronisation process

Both devices act as an advertiser and a scanner.
Device B receives advertising from Device A and scans it.
Device A sends a scan response that contains ``Manufacturer Specific Data``.
This message contains the following fields:

   * Company Identifier Code.
   * Identifier indicating that the device supports distance measurement.
   * The access address used for measurement.

This scanner/advertiser interaction is used as a synchronisation point.
After a configurable delay, Device A and Device B try to range each other.

   * If a Device acts as an advertiser in synchronization, it will act as the reflector in the ranging procedure.
   * If a Device acts as a scanner in synchronization, it will act as the initiator in the ranging procedure.

The synchronization will be performed cyclically.

Based on the ``SCAN_RSP`` response, the device recognizes peers that support the distance measurement functionality within its coverage.
The addresses of these devices are stored in a list.
When a device does not respond within a certain period of time, it is removed from the list.
Also the last measurement results with the peers are stored in this list.

User interface
**************

LED 1:
   Indicates the measured distance for MCPD (Multi-carrier phase difference) method. The shorter the distance, the brighter the light.

LED 2:
   Blinks every two seconds with the duty cycle set to 50% when the main loop is running and the device is advertising.

LED 3:
   On when connected.

Building and running

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to development kits, test it by performing the following steps:

1. |connect_terminal_specific|
#. Reset the kit.
#. Program the other development kit with the same sample and reset it.
#. Wait until the devices identify themselves and synchronize.
#. Observe that the received measurement results are output in the terminal window.

Sample output
=============

The result should look similar to the following output:

* The MCPD method::
