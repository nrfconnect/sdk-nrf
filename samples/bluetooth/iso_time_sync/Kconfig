config SDU_INTERVAL_US
	int "SDU interval to be used in microseconds"
	default 10000
	help
	  The SDU interval determines how often the button
	  value will be transmitted to the receiving devices.

config TIMED_LED_PRESENTATION_DELAY_US
	int "The delay of presenting the new value of the LED"
	default 5000
	help
	  The presentation delay of the LED represents the time
	  from the SDU synchronization reference until the value
	  is applied.
	  The application needs to ensure it can process the
	  received SDU within this amount of time.
	  The end-to-end latency will be at least the sum
	  of the configured transport latency and presentation delay

config LED_TOGGLE_IMMEDIATELY_ON_SEND_OR_RECEIVE
	bool "Enable immediate LED toggling upon sending or receiving data"
	help
	  Enable immediate toggling of LED2 when isochronous
	  data is sent or received. This allows for measurment
	  of the mimimum end-to-end latency.
