This sample demonstrates how to use the ranging service to request ranging data from a server.
Distance estimates are then computed from the ranging data and logged to the terminal.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

The sample also requires a device running a Channel Sounding Reflector with Ranging Responder to connect to, such as the :ref:`channel_sounding_ras_reflector` sample.

Overview
********

The sample demonstrates a basic BluetoothÂ® Low Energy Central role functionality that acts as a GATT Ranging Requestor client and configures the Channel Sounding initiator role.
Regular Channel Sounding procedures are set up, local subevent data is stored, and peer ranging data is fetched.

User interface
**************

The sample does not require user input and will scan for a device advertising with the GATT Ranging Service UUID.
The first LED on the development kit will be lit when a connection has been established.

Building and running

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, you can test it by connecting to another device programmed with a Channel Sounding Reflector role with Ranging Responder, such as the :ref:`channel_sounding_ras_reflector` sample.

1. |connect_terminal_specific|
#. Reset both kits.
#. Wait until the scanner detects the Peripheral.
   In the terminal window, check for information similar to the following::
