The nRF Auraconfig sample implements the :ref:`BIS gateway mode <nrf53_audio_app_overview>` and may act as an `Auracastâ„¢`_ broadcaster if you are using a preset compatible with Auracast.
The sample features a shell interface that allows you to configure the broadcast source in many different ways.

In the BIS gateway mode, transmitting audio from the broadcast source happens using Broadcast Isochronous Stream (BIS) and Broadcast Isochronous Group (BIG).

.. note::
     This sample is meant to be used with maximum two BIG with four BIS streams each.

.. _nrf_auraconfig_requirements:

Shell commands list
*******************

The nRF Auraconfig uses a shell interface for all user interactions.
This section lists the supported commands.

Description convention
======================

The command argument description uses the following convention:

* Angle brackets mean that an argument is mandatory:

  .. parsed-literal::

* Square brackets mean that an argument is optional:

  .. parsed-literal::
     :class: highlight

     nac [*arg*]

.. _nrf_auraconfig_configuration:

Configuration
*************

|config|

The sample is pre-configured with a generous default memory allocation, suitable for a wide range of use cases.
You can modify these default settings in the :file:`prj.conf` file.
Using aggressive configurations can reduce air time availability for all streams, depending on the combination of options selected (like high bitrates, increased re-transmits, specific PHY settings).

.. _nrf_auraconfig_configuration_sd:

SD card setup
*************

This sample can support pre-encoded LC3 data stored as LC3 files on an SD card.
You can use the `nRF Auracast configuration files`_ provided by Nordic Semiconductor for populating the SD-card.

If you are not using an SD card, the system defaults to sending dummy data.
The purpose of the dummy data is to test that the broadcast source has been correctly configured.

Make sure you format the SD card with a FAT file system.

.. _nrf_auraconfig_building:

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/bluetooth/nrf_auraconfig`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt

The nRF5340 Audio DK comes pre-programmed with basic firmware that indicates if the kit is functional.
See :ref:`nrf53_audio_app_dk_testing_out_of_the_box` for more information.

.. _nrf_auraconfig_testing:

Testing
*******

In this testing procedure, the development kit is programmed with the nRF Auraconfig sample.

To test the nRF Auraconfig sample, complete the following steps:

1. If you are using an :ref:`SD card loaded with the pre-encoded LC3 data <nrf_auraconfig_configuration_sd>`, insert it into your development kit.
#. Turn on the development kit.
#. Set up the serial connection with the development kit.
#. Configure a BIG using use case 1:

   .. code-block:: console

      nac usecase 1

#. Start the broadcaster:

   .. code-block:: console

      nac start

You can now send other shell commands, as listed in the :ref:`nrf_auraconfig_ui`.
