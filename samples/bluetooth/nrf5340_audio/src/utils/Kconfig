config FIFO_FRAME_SPLIT_NUM
	int "Number of blocks to make up one frame of audio data"
	default 10
	help
		Easy DMA in I2S requires two buffers to be filled before I2S
		transmission will begin. In order to reduce latency, an audio
		frame can be split into multiple blocks with this parameter. USB
		sends data in 1 ms blocks, so we need the split to match that.
		Since we set frame size to 10 ms for USB, 10 is selected as
		FRAME_SPLIT_NUM

config FIFO_TX_FRAME_COUNT
	int "Max number of audio frames in TX slab"
	default 3
	help
		FIFO_TX is the buffer that holds decoded audio data before it
		is sent to either I2S or USB

config FIFO_RX_FRAME_COUNT
	int "Max number of audio frames in RX slab"
	default 1
	help
		FIFO_RX is the buffer that holds uncompressed audio data coming
		from either I2S or USB
