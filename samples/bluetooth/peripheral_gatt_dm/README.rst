The Peripheral GATT Discovery Manager sample demonstrates how to use the :ref:`gatt_dm_readme`.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

The sample also requires a device to connect to the peripheral, for example, a phone or a tablet with `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ or `nRF Toolbox`_.


Overview
********

When connected to another device, the sample discovers the services of the connected device and outputs the service information.

User interface
**************

Button 1:
   During the pairing procedure, press this button to accept the pairing.

Button 2:
   During the pairing procedure, press this button to reject the pairing.

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your dongle or development kit, test it by performing the following steps.
This testing procedure assumes that you are using `nRF Connect for Mobile`_.

1. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal|
#. Connect to the device from nRF Connect (the device is advertising as "Nordic Discovery Sample").
   When connected, the sample starts discovering the services of the connected device.
#. Observe that the services of the connected device are printed in the terminal emulator.

Dependencies
************

This sample uses the following |NCS| libraries:
