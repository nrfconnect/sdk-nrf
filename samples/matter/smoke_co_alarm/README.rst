Matter: Smoke CO Alarm
######################

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 2

This sample demonstrates the usage of the :ref:`Matter <ug_matter>` application layer to build a device capable of sensing smoke and carbon monoxide, and issuing an alarm if the their concentration is too high.
This device works as a Matter accessory device, meaning it can be paired and controlled remotely over a Matter network built on top of a low-power, 802.15.4 Thread network.
You can use this sample as a reference for creating your own application.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

If you want to commission the device and :ref:`control it remotely <matter_smoke_co_alarm_network_mode>`, you also need a Matter controller device :ref:`configured on PC or mobile <ug_matter_configuring>`.
This requires additional hardware depending on the setup you choose.

.. note::
    |matter_gn_required_note|

Overview
********

The sample does not use real hardware smoke or CO sensors due to hardware limitations.
Instead, it uses :ref:`test event triggers <ug_matter_test_event_triggers>` to test issuing the device alarms, and LEDs to show the current device state.
The smoke CO alarm detects the alarm conditions and issues the appropriate alarm using different LED patterns.

.. note::
   According to the Matter specification requirements, the smoke CO alarm device shall express alarms using both audible and visual indications.
   This sample does not use audible indications because of the lack of suitable hardware on supported development kits.

In case multiple alarm conditions are met, the device expresses only the alarm with the highest priority.
After the alarm with the highest priority is stopped, the device starts expressing the next alarm in the priority order until all alarm conditions have ceased.
The implementation demonstrated in this sample supports issuing the following alarms, listed from the highest priority to the lowest:

* Smoke alarm - Issued if allowed smoke concentration level is exceeded.
* CO alarm - Issued if allowed carbon monoxide concentration level is exceeded.
* Hardware fault alert - Issued if the device hardware is not operating properly.
* Device self-test alert - Issued if the device self-test was started by the user.
* End of service alert - Issued if the device service was ended either by the expiration date or other physical conditions, and it needs to be replaced.
* Battery level alert - Issued if the device battery level is too low.

The sample implements two instances of a Power Source cluster:

* Wired power source on the endpoint 0
* Battery power source on the endpoint 1

The usage of power sources is implemented with a preference to select wired power source and switch to battery power source, only if the wired one is not available.
The power source changes are emulated using :ref:`test event triggers <ug_matter_test_event_triggers>`.
Every power source can be independently enabled or disabled using a dedicated test event trigger.

You can test the device remotely over a Thread network, which requires more devices.

The remote control testing requires a Matter controller that you can configure either on a PC or a mobile device.
You can enable both methods after :ref:`building and running the sample <matter_smoke_co_alarm_sample_remote_control>`.

.. _matter_smoke_co_alarm_sample_lit:

ICD LIT device type
===================

The smoke CO alarm works as a Matter Intermittently Connected Device (ICD) with a :ref:`Long Idle Time (LIT)<ug_matter_device_low_power_icd_sit_lit>`.
The device starts operation in the Short Idle Time (SIT) mode and remains in it until it is commissioned to the Matter fabric and registers the first ICD client.
It then switches the operation mode to LIT to reduce the power consumption.

The sample supports ICD Dynamic SIT LIT switching (DSLS) feature to switch between SIT and LIT modes, depending on the used power source.
The device uses the SIT mode, when the wired power source is active.
Otherwise, it switches to the LIT mode, to indicate that it is possible to save the energy, when using a battery power source.
Dynamic switching is possible only if the ICD device meets all criteria for operating in the LIT mode (it has at least one client registered).
DSLS support is disabled by default.
To enable it, set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHIP_ICD_DSLS_SUPPORT` Kconfig option to ``y``.

In the LIT mode, the device responsiveness is much lower than in the SIT mode.
However, you can request the device to become responsive to, for example, change its configuration.
To do that, you need to use the User Active Mode Trigger (UAT) feature by pressing the appropriate button.

See `User interface`_ for information about how to switch the operation modes.

See `Configuration`_ for information about building the sample with the DFU support.

Selecting a custom configuration
================================

Before you start testing the application, you can select one of the :ref:`matter_smoke_co_alarm_custom_configs`.
See :ref:`app_build_file_suffixes` and :ref:`cmake_options` for more information how to select a configuration.

Testing
=======

After building the sample and programming it to your development kit, complete the following steps to test its basic features.

.. note::
   The following steps use the CHIP Tool controller as an example.
   Visit the :ref:`test event triggers <ug_matter_test_event_triggers>` page to see the code values used for triggering specific alarms.

      #. |connect_terminal_ANSI|
      #. If the device was not erased during the programming, press and hold **Button 1** until the factory reset takes place.
      #. Commission the device to the Matter network.
         See `Commissioning the device`_ for more information.
      #. Observe that **LED 2**, **LED 3** and **LED 4** are turned off, which means that the device does not express any alarm.
      #. Trigger the device self-test by invoking the following command with the *<node_id>* and *<endpoint_id>* replaced with values selected by you (for example, ``1`` and ``1``):

         .. code-block:: console

            ./chip-tool smokecoalarm self-test-request <node_id> <endpoint_id>

         The **LED2**, **LED3** and **LED4** will sequentially flash for 5 seconds.

      #. Test the Smoke alarm by invoking triggers from the General Diagnostics cluster.
         Replace the *<test_event_enable_key>* and *<node_id>* arguments in the presented commands with values selected by you (for example, ``00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF`` and ``1``):

         Nothing will change, because the CO alarm has lower priority than smoke alarm, so it will not be expressed.

.. _matter_smoke_co_alarm_sample_remote_control:

Enabling remote control
=======================

Remote control allows you to control the Matter smoke CO alarm device from an IPv6 network.

`Commissioning the device`_ allows you to set up a testing environment and remotely control the sample over a Matter-enabled Thread network.

.. _matter_smoke_co_alarm_sample_remote_control_commissioning:

Commissioning the device
------------------------

.. include:: ../light_bulb/README.rst
    :start-after: matter_light_bulb_sample_commissioning_start
    :end-before: matter_light_bulb_sample_commissioning_end

Before starting the commissioning procedure, the device must be made discoverable over Bluetooth LE.
The device becomes discoverable automatically upon the device startup, but only for a predefined period of time (1 hour by default).
If the Bluetooth LE advertising times out, enable it again.

Onboarding information
++++++++++++++++++++++

When you start the commissioning procedure, the controller must get the onboarding information from the Matter accessory device.
The onboarding information representation depends on your commissioner setup.

For this sample, you can use one of the following :ref:`onboarding information formats <ug_matter_network_topologies_commissioning_onboarding_formats>` to provide the commissioner with the data payload that includes the device discriminator and the setup PIN code:
