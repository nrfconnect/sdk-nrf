Matter: Temperature Sensor
##########################

   :depth: 2

This sample demonstrates how to use the :ref:`Matter <ug_matter>` application layer to build a device capable of measuring temperature.
This device works as a Matter accessory device, meaning it can be paired and controlled remotely over a Matter network built on top of a low-power 802.15.4 Thread network.
You can use this sample as a reference for creating your own application.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

If you want to commission the device and :ref:`control it remotely <matter_temperature_sensor_network_mode>`, you also need a Matter controller device :ref:`configured on PC or mobile <ug_matter_configuring>`.
This requires additional hardware depending on the setup you choose.

.. note::
    |matter_gn_required_note|

Overview
********

The sample does not use a real temperature sensor due to hardware limitation.
Instead, it simulates temperature measurement following the linearly increasing values from –20 to +20 Celsius degrees.
The measurement results are updated every 10 s and after reaching the maximum value, the temperature drops to the minimum and starts to increase from the beginning.

You can test the device remotely over a Thread network, which requires more devices.

The remote control testing requires a Matter controller that you can configure either on a PC or a mobile device.
You can enable both methods after :ref:`building and running the sample <matter_temperature_sensor_sample_remote_control>`.

See `Configuration`_ for information about building the sample with the DFU support.

Selecting a custom configuration
================================

Before you start testing the application, you can select one of the :ref:`matter_temperature_sensor_custom_configs`.
See :ref:`app_build_file_suffixes` and :ref:`cmake_options` for more information on how to select a configuration.

Testing
=======

After building the sample and programming it to your development kit, complete the following steps to test its basic features.

.. note::
   The following steps use the CHIP Tool controller as an example.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF52 and nRF53 DKs

      #. |connect_kit|
      #. |connect_terminal_ANSI|
      #. If the device was not erased during the programming, press and hold **Button 1** until the factory reset takes place.
      #. Commission the device to the Matter network.
         See `Commissioning the device`_ for more information.
      #. Read the temperature measured by the device by invoking the following command with the *<node_id>* and *<endpoint_id>* replaced with your values (for example, ``1`` and ``1``):

         .. code-block:: console

            ./chip-tool temperaturemeasurement read measured-value <node_id> <endpoint_id>

         The received output will look similar to the following:

         .. code-block:: console

            [1755081048.320] [99348:99350] [TOO] Endpoint: 1 Cluster: 0x0000_0402 Attribute 0x0000_0000 DataVersion: 1994139940
            [1755081048.320] [99348:99350] [TOO]   MeasuredValue: 9

      #. Wait some time, for example 30 s, and read the measured temperature again using the same command as before:

         .. code-block:: console

            ./chip-tool temperaturemeasurement read measured-value <node_id> <endpoint_id>

         The received value will be different, for example:

         .. code-block:: console

            [1755081048.320] [99348:99350] [TOO] Endpoint: 1 Cluster: 0x0000_0402 Attribute 0x0000_0000 DataVersion: 1994139940
            [1755081048.320] [99348:99350] [TOO]   MeasuredValue: 12

   .. group-tab:: nRF54 DKs

      #. |connect_terminal_ANSI|
      #. If the device was not erased during the programming, press and hold **Button 0** until the factory reset takes place.
      #. Commission the device to the Matter network.

.. _matter_temperature_sensor_sample_remote_control:

Enabling remote control
=======================

Remote control allows you to control the Matter temperature sensor device from an IPv6 network.

`Commissioning the device`_ allows you to set up a testing environment and remotely control the sample over a Matter-enabled Thread network.

.. _matter_temperature_sensor_sample_remote_control_commissioning:

Commissioning the device
------------------------

.. include:: ../light_bulb/README.rst
    :start-after: matter_light_bulb_sample_commissioning_start
    :end-before: matter_light_bulb_sample_commissioning_end

Before starting the commissioning procedure, the device must be made discoverable over Bluetooth LE.
The device becomes discoverable automatically upon the device startup, but only for a predefined period of time (one hour by default).
If the Bluetooth LE advertising times out, enable it again.

Onboarding information
++++++++++++++++++++++

When you start the commissioning procedure, the controller must get the onboarding information from the Matter accessory device.
The onboarding information representation depends on your commissioner setup.

For this sample, you can use one of the following :ref:`onboarding information formats <ug_matter_network_topologies_commissioning_onboarding_formats>` to provide the commissioner with the data payload that includes the device discriminator and the setup PIN code:

  .. list-table:: Temperature Sensor sample onboarding information

       - QR Code Payload
       - Manual pairing code
