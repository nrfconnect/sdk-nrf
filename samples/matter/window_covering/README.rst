Matter: Window covering
#######################

   :depth: 2

This sample demonstrates the usage of the :ref:`Matter <ug_matter>` application layer to build a window covering device.
This device works as a Matter accessory device, meaning it can be paired and controlled remotely over a Matter network built on top of a low-power 802.15.4 Thread network.
Additionally, this device works as a Thread :ref:`Synchronized Sleepy End Device (SSED) <thread_ot_device_types>`.

Use this sample as a reference for developing your own application.
See the :ref:`ug_matter_creating_accessory` page for an overview of the process you need to follow.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

If you want to commission the window covering device and :ref:`control it remotely <matter_window_cover_network_mode>` through a Thread network, you also need a Matter controller device :ref:`configured on PC or smartphone <ug_matter_configuring>`.
This requires additional hardware depending on the setup you choose.

.. note::
    |matter_gn_required_note|

Overview
********

The sample uses buttons for gradually changing the position and movement mode of the window cover, and LEDs to show the state of these changes.
The following movement modes are available:

* Lift - In this movement mode, the window cover moves up and down.
* Tilt - In this movement mode, the window cover slats are tilted forward or backward without the cover moving vertically.

See `User interface`_ for information about how to switch the movement modes.

SSED device type
================

The SSED device type was created for the window covering devices to optimize the power usage of the device and communication pattern with the parent.

A Thread Synchronized Sleepy End Device (SSED) is synchronized with its parent router and uses the radio only at scheduled intervals, by using the :ref:`thread_ug_supported_features_csl` feature introduced as one of the `Thread 1.2 Base Features`_.
During those intervals, the device waits for the router to send it any data related to the desired device activity.
The SSED does require sending packets occasionally to keep synchronization with the router.
However, unlike a regular SED, an SSED does not actively communicate with the router by polling and goes into the idle mode between the scheduled activity periods.
If there is no application-related traffic for an extended period of time, the SSED sends a data poll request packet to synchronize with the parent.
Compared to a standard SED, the SSED features can further reduce energy consumption of the device and generate less data traffic.

Sample testing
==============

You can test the sample in the following ways:

* Standalone, using a single DK that runs the window covering application.
* Remotely over the Thread protocol, which requires more devices.

The remote control testing requires a Matter controller that you can configure either on a PC or mobile device (for remote testing in a network).
You can enable both methods after :ref:`building and running the sample <matter_window_cover_sample_remote_control>`.

      LED 1:
         .. include:: /includes/matter_sample_state_led.txt

      LED 2:
         Indicates the lift position of the window cover, which is represented by the brightness of the LED.
         The brightness level ranges from ``0`` to ``255``, where the brightness level set to ``0`` (switched off LED) indicates a fully opened window cover (lifted) and the brightness level set to ``255`` indicates a fully closed window cover (lowered).

         Additionally, the LED starts blinking evenly (500 ms on/500 ms off) when the Identify command of the Identify cluster is received on the endpoint ``1``.
         The command's argument can be used to specify the duration of the effect.

      LED 3:
         Indicates the tilt position of the window cover, which is represented by the brightness of the LED.
         The brightness level ranges from ``0`` to ``255``, where the brightness level set to ``0`` (switched off LED) indicates a fully opened window cover (tilted to a horizontal position) and the brightness level set to ``255`` indicates a fully closed window cover (tilted to a vertical position).

      Button 1:
         .. include:: /includes/matter_sample_button.txt

      Button 2:
         When pressed once and released, it moves the window cover towards the open position by one step.
         Depending on the movement mode of the cover (see `Overview`_), the button decreases the brightness of either  **LED 2** for the lift mode or **LED 3** for the tilt mode.

      Button 3:
         When pressed once and released, it moves the cover towards the closed position by one step.
         Depending on the movement mode of the cover (see `Overview`_), the button increases the brightness of either  **LED 2** for the lift mode or **LED 3** for the tilt mode.

      Button 2 and Button 3:
         When pressed at the same time, they toggle the cover movement mode between lift and tilt.
         After each device reset, the mode is set to lift by default.

         Optionally used for obtaining the `Onboarding information`_ from the Matter accessory device to start the :ref:`commissioning procedure <matter_window_cover_sample_remote_control_commissioning>`.

.. note::
   Completely opening and closing the cover requires 20 button presses (steps).
   Each step takes approximately 200 ms to simulate the real window cover movement.

   The cover position and the LED brightness values are stored in non-volatile memory and are restored after every device reset.
   After the firmware update or factory reset both LEDs are switched off by default, which corresponds to the cover being fully open, both lift-wise and tilt-wise.

.. _matter_window_cover_sample_remote_control:

Enabling remote control
=======================

Remote control allows you to control the Matter window covering device from a Thread network.

`Commissioning the device`_ allows you to set up a testing environment and remotely control the sample over a Matter-enabled Thread network.

.. _matter_window_cover_sample_remote_control_commissioning:

Commissioning the device
------------------------

.. include:: ../light_bulb/README.rst
    :start-after: matter_light_bulb_sample_commissioning_start
    :end-before: matter_light_bulb_sample_commissioning_end

Before starting the commissioning procedure, the device must be made discoverable over Bluetooth LE.
The device becomes discoverable automatically upon the device startup, but only for a predefined period of time (1 hour by default).
If the Bluetooth LE advertising times out, enable it again.

Onboarding information
++++++++++++++++++++++

When you start the commissioning procedure, the controller must get the onboarding information from the Matter accessory device.
The onboarding information representation depends on your commissioner setup.

For this sample, you can use one of the following :ref:`onboarding information formats <ug_matter_network_topologies_commissioning_onboarding_formats>` to provide the commissioner with the data payload that includes the device discriminator and the setup PIN code:
