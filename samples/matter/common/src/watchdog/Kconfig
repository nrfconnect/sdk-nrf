        If enabled, the watchdog will be paused while the CPU is in idle (sleep) state.

        If disabled, the watchdog will not be paused while the CPU is halted by the debugger and
        the device reset will be triggered, if the feeding signal is not received within the
        specified time.

        The default watchdog objects are created in the matter_init.cpp file.
        The watchdog objects are dedicated for Main and Matter threads and are initialized
        using the NCS_SAMPLE_MATTER_WATCHDOG_DEFAULT_FEED_TIME value.

    help
        The default maximum window time defines a time within which the feeding signal must be received
        from all created Watchdog sources to reset the watchdog object's timer.
        If the signals come after elapsing this time, the watchdog timer will not be reset and the
        reboot occur.

config NCS_SAMPLE_MATTER_WATCHDOG_DEFAULT_FEED_TIME

	  The default interval in milliseconds for calling the feeding callback if it exists.

        Enables test event triggers to block Main and Matter stacks for the specific amount of time
        and test Watchdog in this way.
