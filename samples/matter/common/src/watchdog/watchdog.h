 * @brief Watchdog driver wrapper that can be use to detect code blocking and infinite loops
 *
 * It contains a possibility to create a different Watchdog sources that must be fed within the defined timeout.
 *
 * To start the global Watchdog use the Enable() method.
 * This enables and starts all Watchdog source counters and from this point all Watchdog sources must be fed
 * within their feeding windows.
 *
 * Watchdog sources cannot be disabled separately after enabling the Global Watchdog, but you can disable all of
 * them at once using the Disable() static method. After that to re-enable Watchdog sources you need to call
 * Restore() method on each of them and call Enable() method to start the Global Timer once again.
 *
 * Similarly to creating the objects, you must call Restore() method before calling the Enable() method.

	 *	- Automatically, by providing callback function and feed interval value to the constructor as an
