	  Use LEDs to render the current state of the device such as the progress of commissioning of
	  the device into a network or the factory reset initiation. Note that setting this option to
	  'n' does not disable the LED indicating the state of the simulated bolt.

	  Use this setting to set the default Thread (802.15.4) output power for device that
	  uses FEM. This value has a unit in dBm and represents the Tx power at Antenna port of FEM device.
