SUIT: Device firmware update on the nRF54H20 SoC
################################################

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 2

The sample demonstrates how to update and boot the nRF54H20 System-on-Chip (SoC) using the :ref:`Software Update for Internet of Things (SUIT) <ug_nrf54h20_suit_intro>` procedure on the application, radio, and Nordic-controlled cores of the SoC.
The update on the nRF54H20 SoC can be done over Bluetooth® Low Energy or UART.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kit:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20_cpuapp

You need the nRF Device Manager app for SUIT update over Bluetooth Low Energy:

* `nRF Device Manager mobile app for Android`_
  (The minimum required version is v2.2.1.)

* `nRF Device Manager mobile app for iOS`_
  (The minimum required version is v1.8.0.)

To perform a SUIT update over UART using the SMP protocol, install SUIT commands in nrfutil by running the ``nrfutil install suit`` command (requires nrfutil version 0.8.1 or higher).

Overview
********

The sample uses one of the following methods to perform a firmware update on the nRF54H20 SoC, featuring Nordic Semiconductor’s implementation of the SUIT procedure:

* Bluetooth Low Energy and the nRF Device Manager app
* UART and ``nrfutil suit`` commands

The sample demonstrates how to perform a DFU of the application and radio firmware.

SUIT is the only DFU procedure supported for the nRF54H20 SoCs.
To read more about the SUIT procedure, see :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_suit_intro`.

User interface
**************

LED 0:
    The ``CONFIG_N_BLINKS`` Kconfig option sets the number of blinks.
    The default is set to ``1``, causing a single blink to indicate *Version 1*.
    This value can be incremented to represent an update, such as setting it to ``2`` to indicate *Version 2*.

Configuration
*************

|config|

The default configuration uses UART with sequence number 1 (shown as Version 1 in the nRF Device Manager app).

To change the sequence number of the application, configure the ``APP_ROOT_SEQ_NUM`` inside the :file:`VERSION` file, used for :ref:`zephyr:app-version-details` in Zephyr and the |NCS|.
It sets the :ref:`sequence number <ug_suit_dfu_suit_manifest_elements>` of the :ref:`SUIT envelope <ug_suit_dfu_suit_concepts>`’s manifest.
If you do not provide the :file:`VERSION` file, the sample is built with sequence number set to 1 (shown as Version 1 in the nRF Device Manager app).

To change the number of blinks on **LED 0**, configure the ``CONFIG_N_BLINKS`` Kconfig option.
If you do not specify this configuration, the sample is built with the number of blinks set to 1.

Configuration options
=====================

Check and configure the following configuration option for the sample:

.. _CONFIG_N_BLINKS:

CONFIG_N_BLINKS - Configuration for the number of blinks.
   The sample configuration change the number of blinks on **LED 0**.
   The default value is ``1``.

.. _CONFIG_BT_DEVICE_NAME:

CONFIG_BT_DEVICE_NAME - Configuration for Bluetooth Device Name.
   The sample configuration changes the advertised Bluetooth name.
   Its default value is ``SUIT SMP Sample``.

Modify partition sizes
======================

You can also modify the size and location of the partitions.
This is done by modifying the values for the desired location and size of the partition in the devicetree :file:`.overlay` files.

* To modify the application core's partition size, modify the values for ``cpuapp_slot0_partition`` defined in the :file:`nrf/samples/suit/smp_transfer/sysbuild/nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20_memory_map.dtsi`.

* To modify the DFU partition, modify the values for ``dfu_partition`` defined in :file:`samples/suit/smp_transfer/boards/nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20_cpuapp.overlay`.
  This partition is where the update candidate is stored before the update process begins.

Manifest template files
=======================

The SUIT DFU procedure requires an envelope to transport the firmware update, and SUIT envelopes require a SUIT manifest template as a source file.
All required manifest template files (used to later create SUIT envelopes) are automatically created during the first sample build, and are the following:

* The root manifest - :file:`root_hierarchical_envelope.yaml.jinja2`

* The application domain manifest - :file:`app_envelope.yaml.jinja2`

* The radio domain manifest - :file:`rad_envelope.yaml.jinja2`

See :ref:`app_build_output_files_suit_dfu` for a full table of SUIT-generated output files.

.. note::

   The radio domain manifest template (:file:`radio.suit`) is only created when building the Bluetooth Low Energy version of the sample, and not the UART version.
   Currently, it is not needed for the UART version.

If you want to make modifications to how the DFU is executed in this sample, you can do so by editing the manifest templates, or generating your own custom manifests.
See the :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_suit_customize_dfu` user guide for instructions and examples.

.. _nrf54h_suit_sample_extflash:

External flash support
======================

You can build the application with external flash support by running the following command from the sample directory:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf54h20dk/nrf54h20/cpuapp -T ./sample.suit.smp_transfer.cache_push.extflash

With this configuration, the sample is configured to use UART as the transport and the external flash is enabled.
To see which Kconfig options are needed to achieve that, see the ``sample.suit.smp_transfer.cache_push.extflash`` configuration in the :file:`samples/suit/sample.yaml` file.

To enable both the external flash and the BLE transport, use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf54h20dk/nrf54h20/cpuapp -T ./sample.suit.smp_transfer.cache_push.extflash.bt

.. note::
   This way of building the application will enable the push scenario for updating from external flash.
   It will also extract the image to a DFU cache partition file.
   For more information, see :ref:`How to push SUIT payloads to multiple partitions <ug_nrf54h20_suit_push>`.
