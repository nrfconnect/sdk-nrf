The :ref:`Zigbee <ug_zigbee>` NCP sample demonstrates the usage of Zigbee's :ref:`ug_zigbee_platform_design_ncp_details` architecture.

Together with the source code from :ref:`ug_zigbee_tools_ncp_host`, you can use this sample to create a complete and functional Zigbee device.
For example, as shown in the `Testing`_ scenario, you can program a development kit with the NCP sample and bundle it with the simple gateway application on the NCP host processor.

You can then use this sample together with the :ref:`Zigbee light bulb <zigbee_light_bulb_sample>` to set up a basic Zigbee network.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf52840dk_nrf52840, nrf52840dongle_nrf52840, nrf52833dk_nrf52833, nrf21540dk_nrf52840, nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp

You can use any of the development kits listed above.

.. note::
    The nRF52840 Dongle uses a :ref:`different bootloader <zigbee_ncp_bootloader>` than other development kits.

For this sample to work, you also need the following:

* :ref:`ug_zigbee_tools_ncp_host` tool, which is based on the ZBOSS stack and requires a PC with an operating system compatible with the 64-bit Ubuntu 18.04 Linux.
  The tool is available for download as a standalone :file:`zip` package using the following link:

  * `ZBOSS NCP Host`_ (|zigbee_ncp_package_version|)

  For more information, see also the `NCP Host documentation`_.
* The :ref:`zigbee_light_bulb_sample` sample programmed on one separate device.

This means that you need at least two development kits for testing this sample.

   Zigbee NCP sample setup overview

Overview
********

The sample demonstrates using a Nordic Semiconductor's Development Kit as Zigbee Network Co-Processor.

The sample uses the :kconfig:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_LIBRARY_NCP_DEV` Kconfig option, which is available as part of the :ref:`nrfxlib:zboss_configuration`.
The NCP Kconfig option extends the compilation process with an implementation of the ZBOSS API serialization through NCP commands.
It also implements the ZBOSS default signal handler function, which controls the ZBOSS and commissioning logic.

The sample is built to work with bootloader.
See :ref:`zigbee_ncp_bootloader` for more information.

The NCP application creates and starts a ZBOSS thread as well as the communication channel for NCP commands that are exchanged between the connectivity device and the host processor.

Configuration
*************

|config|

See :ref:`ug_zigbee_configuring_eui64` for information about how to configure the IEEE address for this sample.

Serial communication setup
==========================

The communication channel uses Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:uart_api` API.
This serial device is selected with :kconfig:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_UART_DEVICE_NAME`.

By default, the NCP sample communicates through the UART serialization (``UART0``).
As a result, Zephyr's logger is configured to use ``UART1``, which is available through GPIO pins (**P1.00** and **P1.01**).

The ``UART0`` pins are configured by Devicetree :file:`overlay` files for each supported development kit in the :file:`boards` directory.

Communication through USB
-------------------------

You can change the communication channel from the default UART to nRF USB by using the :file:`prj_usb.conf` configuration file and adding the ``-DCONF_FILE='prj_usb.conf'`` flag to the build command.
See :ref:`cmake_options` for instructions on how to add this flag to your build.
For example, when building on the command line, you can do so as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   west build samples/zigbee/ncp -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 -- -DCONF_FILE='prj_usb.conf'

The USB device VID and PID are configured by the sample's Kconfig file.

.. note::
    The USB is used as the default NCP communication channel when using the nRF52840 Dongle.

You can configure :ref:`Zigbee stack logs <zigbee_ug_logging_stack_logs>` to be printed in binary format over the USB CDC using an independent serial port by setting:
* :kconfig:`CONFIG_ZBOSS_TRACE_BINARY_LOGGING` - to enable binary format.
* :kconfig:`CONFIG_ZBOSS_TRACE_USB_CDC_LOGGING` - to select USB CDC serial over UART serial.

No additional changes in application are required. For more configuration options, see :ref:`Zigbee stack logs <zigbee_ug_logging_stack_logs>`.

.. _zigbee_ncp_bootloader:

Bootloader support
==================

The bootloader support in the NCP sample depends on the development kit, its respective build target, and `Serial communication setup`_:

* For the ``nrf52840dongle_nrf52840`` build target, `nRF5 SDK Bootloader`_ is used by default because the dongle comes with this bootloader preinstalled.
* For the ``nrf52840dk_nrf52840``, ``nrf52833dk_nrf52833``, and ``nrf21540dk_nrf52840`` build targets, the following scenarios are possible when building for these build targets:

  * If the `Communication through USB`_ is selected, `MCUboot`_ is enabled by default.
  * If the default UART serial communication channel is used, the bootloader support is not enabled, but MCUboot can be enabled by the user.

MCUboot
-------

When the `Communication through USB`_ is selected, MCUboot in this sample is built with support for single application slot, and uses the USB DFU class driver to allow uploading image over USB.

If you want to use the default UART serial communication channel, you can enable MCUboot by setting the :kconfig:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT` Kconfig option.
To use the same MCUboot configuration as in `Communication through USB`_, you need to provide MCUboot with the Kconfig options included in the :file:`child_image/mcuboot_usb.conf` file.
See :ref:`ug_multi_image_variables` for how to set the required options.

MCUboot with the USB DFU requires a larger partition.
To increase the partition, define the ``PM_STATIC_YML_FILE`` variable that provides the path to the :file:`pm_static.yml` static configuration file in the :file:`configuration` directory for the build target of your choice.

For instructions on how to set these additional options and configuration at build time, see :ref:`cmake_options` and :ref:`configure_application`.

See the following command-line instruction for an example:

.. code-block:: console

   west build samples/zigbee/ncp -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 -- -DCONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y  -Dmcuboot_CONFIG_MULTITHREADING=y -Dmcuboot_CONFIG_BOOT_USB_DFU_WAIT=y -Dmcuboot_CONFIG_SINGLE_APPLICATION_SLOT=y -DPM_STATIC_YML_FILE=samples/zigbee/ncp/configuration/nrf52840dk_nrf52840/pm_static.yml

When building the sample, the build system also generates the signed :file:`app_update.bin` image file in the :file:`build` directory.
This file can be used to upgrade a device.
See :ref:`mcuboot_ncs` for more information about this and other automatically generated files.

After every reset, the sample first boots to MCUboot and then, after a couple of seconds, the NCP sample is booted.
When booted to MCUboot, the new image can be uploaded with the dfu-util tool.
See :ref:`USB DFU sample documentation <zephyr:usb_dfu>` for a reference.

To learn more about configuring bootloader for an application in |NCS|, see the :ref:`ug_bootloader` page.

nRF5 SDK Bootloader
-------------------

When the sample is built for ``nrf52840dongle_nrf52840``, the build system does not produce an upgrade image.
to upgrade the dongle, you can use one of the following options:

* nRF Connect Programmer application (part of `nRF Connect for Desktop`_).
  For more details, see `Programming the nRF52840 Dongle`_ in the nRF Connect Programmer user guide.
* `nRF Util`_ tool, if you do not want to use the nRF Connect Programmer application.
  To generate a DFU package, see `Generating DFU packages`_ in the nRF Util user guide.
  Upgrading the dongle using this method requires putting the dongle into the DFU mode.
  When in the DFU mode, you can use `nRF Util`_ for sending the upgrade image.
  See `DFU over a serial USB connection`_ in the nRF Util user guide.

  .. note::
      By default, you can enter the DFU mode on the dongle using the pin reset.
      Alternatively, you can also trigger the bootloader on the dongle from the NCP Host application by calling :c:func:`ncp_host_ota_run_bootloader`.

Testing
=======

After building the sample and programming it to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

1. Download and extract the `ZBOSS NCP Host`_ package.

   .. note::
      If you are using an Linux distribution different than the 64-bit Ubuntu 18.04, make sure to rebuild the package libraries and applications by following the instructions described in the `Rebuilding the ZBOSS libraries for host`_ section in the `NCP Host documentation`_.

#. If you are using `Communication through USB`_, connect the nRF USB port of the NCP sample's development kit to the PC USB port with an USB cable.
#. Get the kitâ€™s serial port name (for example, /dev/ttyACM0).
   If you are communicating through the nRF USB, get the nRF USB serial port name.
#. Turn on the development kit that runs the light bulb sample.
#. Start the simple gateway application by running the following command with *serial_port_name* replaced with the serial port name used for communication with the NCP sample:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      NCP_SLAVE_PTY=*serial_port_name* ./application/simple_gw/simple_gw

The simple gateway device forms the Zigbee network and opens the network for 180 seconds for new devices to join.
When the light bulb joins the network, the **LED 3** on the light bulb device turns on to indicate that it is connected to the simple gateway.
The gateway then starts discovering the On/Off cluster.
When it is found, the simple gateway configures bindings and reporting for the device and then starts sending On/Off toggle commands with a 15-second period that toggle the **LED 4** on the light bulb on and off.
