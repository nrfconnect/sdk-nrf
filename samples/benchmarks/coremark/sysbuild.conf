# We need to disable partition manager to avoid build errors for multicore SoCs
# that enable it by default, such as the nRF5340 and nRF54L15.
# For these SoCs, we don't add the second sample-specific sysbuild image
# to the partition manager domains.
# Since the CoreMark sample works correctly without partition manager
# (relying on partition map from DTS), we can disable it for all build configurations.
