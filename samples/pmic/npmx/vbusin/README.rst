The npmx VBUSIN sample demonstrates how to receive PMIC VBUSIN messages using npmx drivers.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf52840dk_nrf52840, nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp

The sample also requires an nPM1300 EK.

Overview
********

This sample uses the npmx VBUSIN driver to do the following:

* Set the current limit for the USB port.
* Register USB CC events.

Wiring
******

#. Connect the TWI interface between the chosen DK and the nPM1300 EK as in the following table:

   .. list-table:: nPM1300 EK connections.
      :widths: 25 25 25
      :header-rows: 1

      * - nPM1300 EK pins
        - nRF5340 DK pins
        - nRF52840 DK pins
      * - GPIO0
        - P1.10
        - P1.10
      * - SDA
        - P1.02
        - P0.26
      * - SCL
        - P1.03
        - P0.27
      * - VOUT2 & GND
        - External supply (P21)
        - External supply (P21)

#. Make the following connections on the nPM1300 EK:

   * Connect a USB power supply to the **J3** connector.
   * Connect a suitable battery to the **J2** connector.
   * On the **P18** pin header, connect **VOUT2** and **VDDIO** pins with a jumper.
   * On the **P2** pin header, connect **VBAT** and **VBATIN** pins with a jumper.
   * On the **P17** pin header, connect all LEDs with jumpers.
   * On the **P13** pin header, connect **RSET1** and **GND** pins with a jumper.
   * On the **P14** pin header, connect **RSET2** and **VSET2** pins with a jumper.

#. Make the following connections on the DK:

   * Set the **SW9** nRF power source switch to **VDD**.
   * Set the **SW10** VEXT â†’ nRF switch to **ON**.
