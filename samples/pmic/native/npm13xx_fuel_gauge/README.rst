The Fuel gauge sample demonstrates how to calculate the state of charge of a development kit battery using `nPM1300 <nPM1300 product website_>`_ or  `nPM1304 <nPM1304 product website_>`_ and the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_fuel_gauge`.

For more information about fuel gauging with the nPM1300 or nPM1304, see `Using the nPM1300 and nPM1304 Fuel Gauge`_.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

The sample also requires an `nPM1300 EK <nPM1300 EK product page_>`_ or an `nPM1304 EK <nPM1304 EK product page_>`_ that you need to connect to the development kit as described in `Wiring`_.

Overview
********

This sample allows to calculate the state of charge, time to empty, and time to full information from a battery on the development kit connected to the nPM1300 or nPM1304 PMIC.

Wiring
******

To connect your DK to the nPM1300 or nPM1304 EK, complete the following steps:

#. Make the following connections on the EK:

   a. Remove all existing connections, including jumpers and USB-C cables.
   #. On the **P1** pin header, connect **VBATIN** and **VBAT** pins with a jumper.
   #. On the **P17** pin header, connect all LEDs with jumpers.
   #. On the **P13** pin header, connect **RSET1** and **VSET1** pins with a jumper.
   #. On the **P14** pin header, connect **RSET2** and **VSET2** pins with a jumper.
   #. If your battery does not include an NTC thermistor, connect the **NTC** and **10kOhm** pins on the **P3** pin header with a jumper.
   #. Connect a suitable battery to either the **J2** or **J1** connector.
      When using the nPM1304 EK, the **J3** connector can also be used.
   #. Connect a USB power supply to the **J3** connector on nPM1300 EK or **J4** connector on nPM1304 EK.

   With these connections, the USB power supply is powering the EK, the BUCK regulators are enabled, and the I/O reference voltage is supplied by the DK as described in the next step.

   .. note::
      Battery charging will not begin if the NTC signal is disconnected.

#. Connect the chosen DK to the EK as in the following table:

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/pmic/native/npm13xx_fuel_gauge`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt

To build this sample for either nPM1300 or nPM1304, you need to apply an appropriate build configuration.
The build configuration consist of choosing a Zephyr shield (``npm1300_ek`` or ``npm1304_ek``) and
applying an extra devicetree overlay file (``npm1300.overlay`` or ``npm1304.overlay``)
You can use either the nRF Connect for VS Code extension or the command line.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF Connect for VS Code

      To choose a shield, add an **Extra CMake argument** in your build configuration, for example:

      .. code-block:: bash

         -Dnpm13xx_fuel_gauge_SHIELD=npm1300_ek

      To apply an extra overlay, choose the respective file from the **Extra Devicetree overlays** drop-down menu

   .. group-tab:: Command line

      To apply the appropriate configuration, use the ``-T`` argument of the ``west build`` command.
      For example, to build for an nRF54L15 DK and an nPM1300 EK use the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         west build -b nrf54l15dk/nrf54l15/cpuapp samples/pmic/native/npm13xx_fuel_gauge -T sample.npm1300_fuel_gauge_compile

Testing
