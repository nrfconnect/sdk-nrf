The One button sample demonstrates how to support wake-up, shutdown, and user interactions of `nPM1300 <nPM1300 product website_>`_ or `nPM1304 <nPM1304 product website_>`_ using a single button connected to the PMIC's **SHPHLD/RESET** pin.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

The sample also requires an `nPM1300 EK <nPM1300 EK product page_>`_ or an nPM1304 EK that you need to connect to the development kit as described in `Wiring`_.

Overview
********

The PMIC's **SHPHLD/RESET** button controls the device state.
The sample controls an LED, load switch and PMIC power mode based on button press duration.

The PMIC's **GPIO3** pin is configured as an interrupt output, and is used to signal button press and USB detection events to the host.

Wiring
******

To connect your DK to the nPM1300 or nPM1304 EK, complete the following steps:

#. Make the following connections on the EK:

   * Remove all existing connections.
   * On the **P1** pin header, connect **VBATIN** and **VBAT** pins with a jumper.
   * On the **P13** pin header, connect **RSET1** and **VSET1** pins with a jumper.
   * On the **P14** pin header, connect **RSET2** and **VSET2** pins with a jumper.
   * On the **P15** pin header, connect **VOUT1** and **LSIN1** pins with a jumper.
   * On the **P17** pin header, connect **HOST** and **LED2** pins with a jumper.
   * Connect a suitable battery to the **J2** connector.

#. Connect the chosen DK to the EK as in the following table:

   When using the :zephyr:board:`nrf54l15dk`, the PMIC **GPIO3** interrupt pin assignment uses the DK's **BUTTON 3** pin.

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/pmic/native/npm13xx_one_button`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt

To build this sample for either nPM1300 or nPM1304, you need to apply an appropriate build configuration.
The build configuration consist of choosing a Zephyr shield (``npm1300_ek`` or ``npm1304_ek``) and
applying an extra devicetree overlay file (``npm1300.overlay`` or ``npm1304.overlay``)
You can use either the nRF Connect for VS Code extension or the command line.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF Connect for VS Code

      To choose a shield, add an **Extra CMake argument** in your build configuration, for example:

      .. code-block:: bash

         -DSHIELD=npm1300_ek

      To apply an extra overlay, choose the respective file from the **Extra Devicetree overlays** drop-down menu

   .. group-tab:: Command line

      To apply the appropriate configuration, use the ``-T`` argument of the ``west build`` command.
      For example, to build for an nRF54L15 DK and an nPM1300 EK use the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         west build -b nrf54l15dk/nrf54l15/cpuapp samples/pmic/native/npm13xx_one_button -T sample.npm1300_one_button_compile

Testing
*******

|test_sample|

#. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal|

If the initialization was successful, the terminal displays the following message with status information:

.. code-block:: console

   PMIC device ok

Different length button presses:

.. _table::
   :widths: auto

   ============  ============  =========================================================
   Duration      Log output    Outcome
   ============  ============  =========================================================
   < 1 sec       Short press   Sample flashes **LED** at 5 Hz, LDSW 1 enabled
   1 - 5 sec     Medium press  Sample flashes **LED** at 1 Hz, LDSW 1 disabled
   5 - 10 sec    Long press    PMIC enters ship mode provided **J3** is not connected
   > 10 sec      None          PMIC long press reset activates
   ============  ============  =========================================================

Ship mode is the lowest power state of the PMIC.
To exit ship mode, press the **SHPHLD** button or attach a USB cable to **J3**.
In a production design, this powers off any device that is powered from a PMIC output.

The long press reset performs a full power cycle of the PMIC and resets all setting to powerup defaults.
In a production design, this power cycles any device that is powered from a PMIC output.

When using a separately powered development kit, you must restart the application to reconfigure the PMIC after exiting the ship mode or long press reset.
