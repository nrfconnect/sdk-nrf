  name: Protected Memory PERIPHCONF Sample
  description: |
    Sample demonstrating UICR.PROTECTEDMEM protection of the periphconf_partition.
    The sample relocates periphconf_partition to be right after
    cpuapp_boot_partition and configures PROTECTEDMEM to protect both partitions.
    The sample writes to the protected area, reboots, and demonstrates that the
    integrity check fails on boot, preventing the device from booting when the
    protected memory is modified.
