  name: Secondary Boot APPLICATIONLOCKUP Trigger Sample
  description: |
    Sample demonstrating automatic secondary boot triggered by APPLICATIONLOCKUP
    on nRF54H20DK. The primary image deliberately triggers a CPU lockup, and the
    UICR.SECONDARY.TRIGGER.APPLICATIONLOCKUP configuration causes IronSide SE to
    automatically boot the secondary image.
