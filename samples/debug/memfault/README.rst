The Memfault sample shows how to use the `Memfault SDK`_ in an |NCS| application to collect coredumps and metrics.
The sample connects to an LTE network using an nRF91 Series DK or a Thingy:91, or to Wi-FiÂ®  using the nRF7002 DK, and sends the collected data to Memfault's cloud using HTTPS.

To get started with Memfault integration in |NCS|, see :ref:`ug_memfault`.

Requirements
************

Before using this sample, make sure to sign up in the `Memfault registration page`_ and `create a new project in Memfault`_.
You will be directed to the Integration guide for Memfault.
You will receive the ``project key`` here to set in the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_PROJECT_KEY` Kconfig option.

The sample supports the following development kits:

Overview
********

In this sample, Memfault SDK is used as a module in |NCS| to collect coredumps, reboot reasons, metrics and trace events from devices and send to the Memfault cloud.
See `Memfault terminology`_ for more details on the various Memfault concepts.

Metrics
=======

The sample adds properties specific to the application, while the :ref:`Memfault SDK integration layer <mod_memfault>` in |NCS| adds the system property metrics.
See `Memfault: Collecting Device Metrics`_ for details on working and implementation of metrics.
Some metrics are collected by the Memfault SDK directly.
There are also some metrics, which are specific to |NCS| that are enabled by default:

* LTE metrics:

  * Enabled and disabled using :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_LTE_METRICS`.
  * ``ncs_lte_time_to_connect_ms`` - Time from the point when the device starts to search for an LTE network until the time when it gets registered with the network.
  * ``ncs_lte_connection_loss_count`` - The number of times that the device has lost the LTE network connection after the initial network registration.

* Stack usage metrics:

  * Shows how many bytes of unused space is left in a stack.
  * Configurable using :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_STACK_METRICS`.
  * ``ncs_connection_poll_unused_stack``- Stack used by the cloud libraries for :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud`, :ref:`lib_aws_iot` and :ref:`lib_azure_iot_hub`.

In addition to showing the capturing of metrics provided by the Memfault SDK integration layer in |NCS|, the sample also shows how to capture an application-specific metric.
This metric is defined in :file:`samples/debug/memfault/config/memfault_metrics_heartbeat_config.h`:

*  ``switch_1_toggle_count`` - The number of times **Switch 1** has been toggled on an nRF9160 DK.

Error tracking with trace events
================================

The sample implements a user-defined trace reason for demonstration purposes.
The trace reason is called ``switch_2_toggled``, and is collected every time **Switch 2** is toggled on an nRF9160 DK.
In addition to detection of the event, the trace includes the current switch state.
See `Memfault: Error Tracking with Trace Events`_ for information on how to configure and use trace events.

Coredumps
=========

The sample enables Memfault shell by default.
The shell offers multiple commands to test a wide range of functionality offered by the Memfault SDK.
Run the command ``mflt help`` in the terminal for more information on the available commands.

Coredumps can be triggered in the following ways:

*  Press **Button 1** to trigger stack overflow
*  Press **Button 2** to trigger division by zero
*  Use the Memfault shell to trigger a specific fault.
   Run the command ``mflt test help`` to see the possible options.

These faults cause crashes that are captured by Memfault.
After rebooting, the crash data can be sent to the Memfault cloud for further inspection and analysis.
See `Memfault documentation <Memfault Docs_>`_ for more information on the debugging possibilities offered by the Memfault platform.

Configuration
*************

The Memfault SDK allows the configuration of some of its options using Kconfig.
To configure the options in the SDK that are not available for configuration using Kconfig, use :file:`samples/debug/memfault/config/memfault_platform_config.h`.
See `Memfault SDK`_ for more information.

|config|

Minimal setup
=============

To send data to the Memfault cloud, a project key must be configured using :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_PROJECT_KEY`.
If you are using the nRF7002 DK and want to automatically connect to a Wi-Fi network upon boot, configure the Wi-Fi credentials using the Kconfig options :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_WIFI_CREDENTIALS_STATIC_SSID` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_WIFI_CREDENTIALS_STATIC_PASSWORD`.

.. note::
   The Memfault SDK requires certificates required for the HTTPS transport.
   The certificates are by default provisioned automatically by the |NCS| integration layer for Memfault SDK to sec tags 1001 - 1005.
   If other certificates exist at these sec tags, HTTPS uploads will fail.


Additional configuration
========================

There are two sources for Kconfig options when using Memfault SDK in |NCS|:

* Kconfig options defined within the Memfault SDK.
* Kconfig options defined in the |NCS| integration layer of the Memfault SDK. These configuration options are prefixed with ``CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS``.

Check and configure the following options in Memfault SDK that are used by the sample:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_LOGGING_ENABLE`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_LOG_LEVEL_DBG`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_ROOT_CERT_STORAGE_NRF9160_MODEM`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_SHELL`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_HTTP_ENABLE`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD_INTERVAL_SECS`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD_USE_DEDICATED_WORKQUEUE`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_COREDUMP_COLLECT_BSS_REGIONS`

If :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_ROOT_CERT_STORAGE_NRF9160_MODEM` is enabled, TLS certificates used for HTTP uploads are provisioned to the nRF91 Series modem when :c:func:`memfault_zephyr_port_install_root_certs` is called.

Check and configure the following options for Memfault that are specific to |NCS|:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_PROJECT_KEY`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_LTE_METRICS`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_STACK_METRICS`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_INTERNAL_FLASH_BACKED_COREDUMP`

If :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_INTERNAL_FLASH_BACKED_COREDUMP` is enabled, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_PARTITION_SIZE_MEMFAULT_STORAGE` can be used to set the flash partition size for the flash storage.
