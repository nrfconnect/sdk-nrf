Event Manager
#############

The Event Manager sample demonstrates the functionality of the :ref:`event_manager` subsystem.
It uses an event-driven architecture, where different modules communicate through sending and processing events.


Overview
********

The sample application consists of three modules that communicate using events:

Sensor (``sensor_simulated.c``):
  This module waits for a configuration event (which is sent by ``main.c``).
  After receiving this event, it simulates measured data at constant intervals.
  Every time the data is updated, the module sends the current values as measurement event.
  When the module receives a control event from the Controller, it responds with an ACK event.

Controller (``controller.c``):
  This module waits for measurement events from the sensor.
  Every time a measurement event is received, the module checks one of the measurement values that are transmitted as part of the event and, if the value exceeds a static threshold, sends a control event.

Statistics (``stats.c``):
  This module waits for measurement events from the sensor.
  Every time a measurement event is received, the module calculates simple statistics about one of the measurement values that are transmitted as part of the event and logs them.


Requirements
************

* One of the following development boards:

  * nRF9160 DK board (PCA10090)
  * nRF52840 Development Kit board (PCA10056)
  * nRF52 Development Kit board (PCA10040)
  * nRF51 Development Kit board (PCA10028)


Building and running
********************

This sample can be found under :file:`samples/event_manager` in the |NCS| folder structure.

See :ref:`gs_programming` for information about how to build and program the application.


Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your board, test it by performing the following steps:

#. Connect to the board with a terminal emulator (for example, PuTTY).
   See :ref:`putty` for the required settings.
#. Observe that output similar to the following is logged on UART::
