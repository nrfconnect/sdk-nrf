The Event Manager sample demonstrates the functionality of the :ref:`event_manager` subsystem.
It uses an event-driven architecture, where different modules communicate through sending and processing events.


Overview
********

The sample application consists of three modules that communicate using events:

Sensor (``sensor_simulated.c``):
  This module waits for a configuration event (which is sent by ``main.c``).
  After receiving this event, it simulates measured data at constant intervals.
  Every time the data is updated, the module sends the current values as measurement event.
  When the module receives a control event from the Controller, it responds with an ACK event.

Controller (``controller.c``):
  This module waits for measurement events from the sensor.
  Every time a measurement event is received, the module checks one of the measurement values that are transmitted as part of the event and, if the value exceeds a static threshold, sends a control event.

Statistics (``stats.c``):
  This module waits for measurement events from the sensor.
  The module calculates and logs basic statistics about one of the measurement values that are transmitted as part of the event.

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

1. |connect_terminal|
#. Reset the kit.
#. Observe that output similar to the following is logged on UART::
