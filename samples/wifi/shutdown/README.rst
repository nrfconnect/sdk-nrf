Wi-Fi: Shutdown
###############

   :depth: 2

The Shutdown sample demonstrates how to put the Nordic Semiconductor's Wi-FiÂ® chipset in the Shutdown state, where the device is completely powered off.
For more information, see the `nRF70 Series power states`_ page.

This also demonstrates how to achieve the lowest possible power consumption in the Host SoC (nRF53, nRF52 or nRF91 Series) when Wi-Fi is enabled but not being used.

The sample supports the following three modes of operation:

* Continuous mode (default): Continuously cycles between Wi-Fi startup and shutdown with a configurable timeout.
* One-shot mode: Performs Wi-Fi startup followed by shutdown once, then remains in shutdown mode.
* Buttons mode: Manual control of Wi-Fi startup and shutdown using buttons.

Requirements

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

Overview
********

The sample can demonstrate Wi-Fi shutdown and achieve the lowest possible power consumption in the Host SoC.
It operates in one of the following three modes, based on the selected configuration:

* In Continuous mode(default), the sample performs the following steps:

1. Initializes the Wi-Fi driver and powers up the nRF70 device.
#. Scans for available Wi-Fi networks to verify that the Wi-Fi driver is operational.
#. Brings down the Wi-Fi network interface, which automatically directs the Wi-Fi driver to power down the nRF70 device.
#. Puts the Host SoC in the lowest possible power consumption mode.
#. Waits for the configured timeout period (``SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_S``).
#. Repeats the cycle from step 1.

* In One-shot mode, the sample performs steps 1-4 once, then remains in shutdown mode permanently.

* In Buttons mode, the Wi-Fi state is controlled manually based on user button interactions.

User Interface
**************

The user interface depends on the selected mode of operation:

Buttons mode only:

Button 1:
   Wakes up the Host SoC, brings up the Wi-Fi network interface, which automatically directs the Wi-Fi driver to power on the nRF70 device.
   The sample then scans for available Wi-Fi networks to verify that the Wi-Fi driver is operational.

Button 2:
   Brings down the Wi-Fi network interface, which automatically directs the Wi-Fi driver to power down the nRF70 device.
   The Host SoC is put into the lowest possible power consumption mode.

Continuous and One-shot modes:

User interaction required.
The sample operates automatically according to the selected mode.

Modes of Operation
==================

To build for the nRF7002 DK and nRF7000 EK with nRF5340 DK in different modes of operation, see the following examples:

Continuous mode (Default)
-------------------------

* For nRF7002 DK:

 .. code-block:: console

    west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp

* For nRF7000 EK with nRF5340 DK:

 .. code-block:: console

    west build -p -b nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DSHIELD=nrf7002ek_nrf7000

One-shot mode
-------------

* For nRF7002 DK:

 .. code-block:: console

    west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DCONFIG_OPERATION_MODE_ONE_SHOT=y -DCONFIG_NRF_WIFI_IF_AUTO_START=n

* For nRF7000 EK with nRF5340 DK:

 .. code-block:: console

    west build -p -b nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DSHIELD=nrf7002ek_nrf7000 -DCONFIG_OPERATION_MODE_ONE_SHOT=y -DCONFIG_NRF_WIFI_IF_AUTO_START=n

Buttons mode
------------

* For nRF7002 DK:

 .. code-block:: console

    west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DCONFIG_OPERATION_MODE_BUTTONS=y

* For nRF7000 EK with nRF5340 DK:

 .. code-block:: console

    west build -p -b nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DSHIELD=nrf7002ek_nrf7000 -DCONFIG_OPERATION_MODE_BUTTONS=y

Configuration options
=====================

Disable auto-start of the Wi-Fi driver
--------------------------------------

The Wi-Fi network interface is automatically brought up when the Wi-Fi driver is initialized by default.
You can disable it by setting the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_WIFI_IF_AUTO_START` Kconfig option to ``n``.
This is automatically set for One-shot mode.

.. code-block:: console

   west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DCONFIG_NRF_WIFI_IF_AUTO_START=n

Adjust shutdown timeout
-----------------------

In Continuous mode, you can configure the timeout period between shutdown and restart cycles using the ``SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_S`` option (in seconds):

.. code-block:: console

   west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DCONFIG_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_S=10
