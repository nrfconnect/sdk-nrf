The Shutdown sample demonstrates how to put the Nordic Semiconductor's Wi-FiÂ® chipset in shutdown mode.
This also demonstrates how to achieve the lowest possible power consumption in the nRF5340 SoC when Wi-Fi is enabled but not in use.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

Overview
********

The sample can demonstrate Wi-Fi shutdown and achieve the lowest possible power consumption in the nRF5340 SoC.
The sample:

1. Initializes the Wi-Fi driver.
#. Scans for available Wi-Fi networks to verify that the Wi-Fi driver is operational.
#. Shuts down the Wi-Fi driver.
#. Puts the nRF5340 SoC in the lowest possible power consumption mode.

User Interface
**************

Button 1:
   Wakes up the nRF5340 SoC and initializes the Wi-Fi chipset.
   The sample then scans for available Wi-Fi networks to verify that the Wi-Fi driver is operational.

Button 2:
   Shuts down the Wi-Fi driver.
   The nRF5340 SoC is put into the lowest possible power consumption mode.


Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/wifi/shutdown`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

To build for the nRF7002 DK, use the ``nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp`` build target.
The following is an example of the CLI command to demonstrate Wi-Fi shutdown:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp
