Wi-Fi: Shutdown

The Shutdown sample demonstrates how to put the Nordic Semiconductor's Wi-FiÂ® chipset in the Shutdown state, where the device is completely powered off.
For more information, see the `nRF70 Series power states`_ page.

This also demonstrates how to achieve the lowest possible power consumption in the Host SoC (nRF53, nRF52 or nRF91 Series) when Wi-Fi is enabled but not being used.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

Overview
********

The sample can demonstrate Wi-Fi shutdown and achieve the lowest possible power consumption in the Host SoC.
The sample:

1. Initializes the Wi-Fi driver.
#. Scans for available Wi-Fi networks to verify that the Wi-Fi driver is operational.
#. Brings down the Wi-Fi network interface, which automatically directs the Wi-Fi driver to power down the nRF70 device.
#. Puts the Host SoC in the lowest possible power consumption mode.


User Interface
**************

Button 1:
   Wakes up the Host SoC, brings up the Wi-Fi network interface, which automatically directs the Wi-Fi driver to power on the nRF70 device.
   The sample then scans for available Wi-Fi networks to verify that the Wi-Fi driver is operational.

Button 2:
   Brings down the Wi-Fi network interface, which automatically directs the Wi-Fi driver to power down the nRF70 device.
   The Host SoC is put into the lowest possible power consumption mode.


Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/wifi/shutdown`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

To build for the nRF7002 DK, use the ``nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp`` board target.
The following is an example of the CLI command to demonstrate Wi-Fi shutdown:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp

Disable auto-start of the Wi-Fi driver
--------------------------------------

The Wi-Fi network interface is automatically brought up when the Wi-Fi driver is initialized by default.
You can disable it by setting the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_WIFI_IF_AUTO_START` Kconfig option to ``n``.

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -DCONFIG_NRF_WIFI_IF_AUTO_START=n

With this configuration, the Wi-Fi network interface is not automatically brought up by the Zephyr networking stack.
You must press **Button 1** to bring up the Wi-Fi network interface.
