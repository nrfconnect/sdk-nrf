The Promiscuous sample demonstrates how to set Promiscuous mode, establish a connection to an Access Point (AP), analyze incoming Wi-FiÂ® packets, and print packet statistics.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

Overview
********

The sample demonstrates how to configure the nRF70 Series device in Promiscuous mode, and how to connect the Wi-Fi station to a specified access point using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
It analyzes the incoming Wi-Fi packets on a raw socket and prints the packet statistics at a fixed interval.

Configuration

Configuration options
=====================

The following sample-specific Kconfig options are used in this sample (located in :file:`samples/wifi/promiscuous/Kconfig`):

.. options-from-kconfig::
   :show-type:

You must configure the following Wi-Fi credentials in the :file:`prj.conf` file:

.. include:: /includes/wifi_credentials_static.txt

.. note::
   You can also use ``menuconfig`` to configure ``Wi-Fi credentials``.

See :ref:`zephyr:menuconfig` in the Zephyr documentation for instructions on how to run ``menuconfig``.

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/wifi/promiscuous`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

To build for the nRF7002 DK, use the ``nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp`` board target.
The following is an example of the CLI command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp

Change the board target as given below for the nRF7002 EK.

.. code-block:: console

   nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DSHIELD=nrf7002ek
