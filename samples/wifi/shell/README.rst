The Shell sample allows you to test Nordic Semiconductor's Wi-FiÂ® chipsets.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

Overview
********

The sample can perform all Wi-Fi operations in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands depending on the capabilities supported in the underlying chipset.

Using this sample, the development kit can associate with, and ping to, any Wi-Fi capable access point in :abbr:`STA (Station)` mode.

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/wifi/shell`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

Currently, the following configurations are supported:

* nRF7002 DK + QSPI
* nRF7002 EK + SPIM
* nRF91 Series DK + SPIM


To build for the nRF7002 DK, use the ``nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp`` board target.
The following is an example of the CLI command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp

To build for the nRF7002 EK with nRF5340 DK, use the ``nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp`` board target with the ``SHIELD`` CMake option set to ``nrf7002ek``.
The following is an example of the CLI command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DSHIELD=nrf7002ek

To build with ``raw_tx`` shell support for the nRF7002 DK, use the ``nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp`` board target and raw TX overlay configuration.
The following is an example of the CLI command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-raw-tx.conf

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF9161 DK

      To build for the nRF9161 DK, use the ``nrf9161dk/nrf9161/ns`` board target with the ``SHIELD`` CMake option set to ``nrf7002ek`` and a scan-only overlay configuration.
      The following is an example of the CLI command:

      .. code-block:: console

         west build -p -b nrf9161dk/nrf9161/ns -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-scan-only.conf -DSHIELD=nrf7002ek

   .. group-tab:: nRF9160 DK

      To build for the nRF9160 DK, use the ``nrf9160dk/nrf9160/ns`` board target with the ``SHIELD`` CMake option set to ``nrf7002ek`` and a scan-only overlay configuration.
      The following is an example of the CLI command:

    .. code-block:: console

       west build -b nrf9160dk/nrf9160/ns -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-scan-only.conf -DSHIELD=nrf7002ek

See also :ref:`cmake_options` for instructions on how to provide CMake options.

================

To test the SAP mode, the sample must be built using the configuration overlay :file:`overlay-sap.conf` file.

|test_sample|

#. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal|

#. Set the appropriate regulatory domain using the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

   For example, to set the regulatory domain to IN, use the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      wifi reg_domain IN
#. Set an IP address for the SAP interface using the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      net ipv4 add 1 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0

#. Enable the Access Point mode using the following command:

   ``<SSID>`` is the SSID of the network you want to connect to, ``<psk>`` is its passphrase, and the ``<key_management>`` is the security type used by the network.

#. Check the SAP status after a while, using the following command:

        TWT: Not supported

#. Connect a station to the SAP using a static IP address and verify the connection using the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

        wifi ap stations

   If the station is connected, you should see an output similar to the following:

#. Verify connectivity by pinging the Station from the SAP using the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      net ping <station IP address>

   See the following example:

   .. code-block:: console

      net ping 192.168.1.88
