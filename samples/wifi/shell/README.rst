This sample allows you to test Nordic Semiconductor's Wi-FiÂ® chipsets.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kit:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

Overview
********

This sample can perform all Wi-Fi operations in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands depending on the capabilities supported in the underlying chipset.

Using this sample, the development kit can associate with, and ping to, any Wi-Fi capable access point in :abbr:`STA (Station)` mode.

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/wifi/shell`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

Currently, the following configurations are supported:

* 7002 DK + QSPI
* 7002 EK + SPIM
* 9160 DK + SPIM


To build for the nRF7002 DK, use the ``nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp`` build target.
The following is an example of the CLI command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp

To build for the nRF7002 EK, use the ``nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp`` build target with the ``SHIELD`` CMake option set to ``nrf7002_ek``.
The following is an example of the CLI command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp -- -DSHIELD=nrf7002_ek

To build for the nRF9160 DK, use the ``nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns`` build target with the ``SHIELD`` CMake option set to ``nrf7002_ek`` and scan-only overlay configuration.
The following is an example of the CLI command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns -- -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-scan-only.conf -DSHIELD=nrf7002_ek

See also :ref:`cmake_options` for instructions on how to provide CMake options.

Testing
=======

|test_sample|

#. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal|
#. Scan for the Wi-Fi networks in range using the following command::

     wifi scan

   The output should be similar to the following::

      Scan requested

      Num  | SSID                             (len) | Chan (Band)    | RSSI | Security        | BSSID
      1    | xyza                             4     | 1    (2.4GHz)  | -27  | WPA2-PSK        | xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
      2    | abcd                             4     | 149  (5GHz  )  | -28  | WPA2-PSK        | yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy



#. Connect to your preferred network using the following command::

     wifi connect <SSID> <passphrase>

   ``<SSID>`` is the SSID of the network you want to connect to, and ``<passphrase>`` is its passphrase.

#. Check the connection status after a while, using the following command::

     wifi status

   If the connection is established, you should see an output similar to the following::

      Status: successful
      ==================
      State: COMPLETED
      Interface Mode: STATION
      Link Mode: WIFI 6 (802.11ax/HE)

      BSSID: C0:06:C3:1D:CF:9E
      Band: 5GHz
      Channel: 157
      Security: WPA2-PSK
      PMF: Optional
      RSSI: 0

#. Initiate a ping and verify data connectivity using the following commands::

     net dns <hostname>
     net ping <resolved hostname>

   See the following example::

     net dns google.com
      Query for 'google.com' sent.
      dns: 142.250.74.46
      dns: All results received

     net ping 10 142.250.74.46
