The Station sample demonstrates how to connect the Wi-Fi® station to a specified access point using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

Overview
********

The sample can perform Wi-Fi operations such as connect and disconnect in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands depending on the capabilities of an access point.

Using this sample, the development kit can connect to the specified access point in :abbr:`STA (Station)` mode.

User interface
**************

The sample adds LED support to map with connection and disconnection events.

LED 1:
   Starts blinking when the sample is connected to the access point.

   Stops blinking when the sample is disconnected from the access point.

Configuration
*************

|config|

You must configure the following Wi-Fi credentials in the :file:`prj.conf` file:

* Network name (SSID)
* Key management
* Password

.. note::
   You can also use ``menuconfig`` to enable ``Key management`` option.

See :ref:`zephyr:menuconfig` in the Zephyr documentation for instructions on how to run ``menuconfig``.

Configuration options
=====================

The following sample-specific Kconfig option is used in this sample (located in :file:`samples/wifi/sta/Kconfig`):

.. _CONFIG_NRF700X_QSPI_ENCRYPTION_KEY:

CONFIG_NRF700X_QSPI_ENCRYPTION_KEY
   This option specifies the QSPI encryption key.

Quad Serial Peripheral Interface (QSPI) encryption
**************************************************

This sample demonstrates QSPI encryption API usage.
You can set the key using the :ref:`CONFIG_NRF700X_QSPI_ENCRYPTION_KEY <CONFIG_NRF700X_QSPI_ENCRYPTION_KEY>` Kconfig option.

If encryption of the QSPI traffic is required for the production devices, matching keys must be programmed in both the nRF7002 OTP and non-volatile storage associated with the host.
The key from non-volatile storage must be set as the encryption key using the APIs.

Power management
****************

This sample also enables Zephyr's power management policy by default, which sets the nRF5340 :term:`System on Chip (SoC)` into low-power mode whenever it is idle.
See :ref:`zephyr:pm-guide` in the Zephyr documentation for more information on power management.

IP addressing
*************
The sample uses DHCP to obtain an IP address for the Wi-Fi interface.
It starts with a default static IP address to handle networks without DHCP servers, or if the DHCP server is not available.
Successful DHCP handshake will override the default static IP configuration.

You can change the following default static configuration in the :file:`prj.conf` file:

.. code-block:: console

  CONFIG_NET_CONFIG_MY_IPV4_ADDR="192.168.1.98"
  CONFIG_NET_CONFIG_MY_IPV4_NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
  CONFIG_NET_CONFIG_MY_IPV4_GW="192.168.1.1"

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/wifi/sta`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

Currently, only the nRF7002 DK is supported.

To build for the nRF7002 DK, use the ``nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp`` build target.
The following is an example of the CLI command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp

Power management testing
************************

You can use this sample to measure the current consumption of both the nRF5340 SoC and the nRF7002 device independently by using two separate Power Profiler Kit II (PPK2) devices.
The nRF5340 SoC is connected to the first PPK2 and the nRF7002 DK is connected to the second PPK2.

See `Measuring current`_ for more information about how to set up and measure the current consumption of both the nRF5340 SoC and the nRF7002 device.

The average current consumption in an idle case can be around ~1-2 mA in the nRF5340 SoC and ~20 µA in the nRF7002 device.

See :ref:`app_power_opt` for more information on power management testing and usage of the PPK2.
