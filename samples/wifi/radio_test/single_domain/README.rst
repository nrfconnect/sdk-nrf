Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi Bluetooth LE Radio test (Single domain)
####################################################

The Wi-Fi Bluetooth LE Radio test sample demonstrates how to use the radio test for both Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth® LE protocols using a single domain image, that is, both running on the same core (application core).
The sample shows how to use the radio test subcommands to configure the parameters and run the radio test.

The Wi-Fi Radio test also supports programming the Factory Information Configuration Registers (FICR) fields defined in the nRF7002 one-time programmable (OTP) memory.

See the below links for detailed documentation on the sample and its features.
