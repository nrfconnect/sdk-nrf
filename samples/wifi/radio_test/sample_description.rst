The Wi-Fi Radio test sample demonstrates how to configure the Wi-Fi® radio in a specific mode and then test its performance.
The sample provides a set of predefined commands that allow you to configure the radio in the following modes:

* Modulated carrier TX
* Modulated carrier RX
* Tone transmission
* IQ sample capture at ADC output

The sample also shows how to program the user region of FICR parameters on the development kit using a set of predefined commands.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

Overview
********

To run the tests, connect to the development kit through the serial port and send shell commands.
Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:shell_api` module is used to handle the commands.

You can start running ``wifi_radio_test`` subcommands to set up and control the radio.
See :ref:`wifi_radio_test_subcmds` for a list of available subcommands.

In the Modulated carrier RX mode, you can use the ``get_stats`` subcommand to display the statistics.
See :ref:`wifi_radio_test_stats` for a list of available statistics.

You can use ``wifi_radio_ficr_prog`` subcommands to read or write OTP registers.
See :ref:`wifi_radio_ficr_prog_subcmds` for a list of available subcommands.

.. note::

   All the FICR registers are stored in the one-time programmable (OTP) memory.
   Consequently, the write commands are destructive. Once written, the contents of the OTP registers cannot be reprogrammed.

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/wifi/radio_test`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt

Currently, the following configurations are supported:

* nRF7002 DK + QSPI
* nRF7002 EK + SPIM


To build for the nRF7002 DK, use the ``nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp`` build target.
The following is an example of the CLI command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp

To build for the nRF7002 EK and nRF5340 DK, use the ``nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp`` build target with the ``SHIELD`` CMake option set to ``nrf7002ek``.
The following is an example of the CLI command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp -- -DSHIELD=nrf7002ek

See also :ref:`cmake_options` for instructions on how to provide CMake options.

              wifi_radio_test tx_tone 0

           .. note::

              Use ``wifi_radio_test tx_tone 0`` only if the command issued before this is ``wifi_radio_test tx_tone 1``.

              wifi_radio_test get_rf_rssi

           The sample shows the following output:

           .. code-block:: console

              wifi_nrf: RF RSSI value is = 0

         .. note::

            RF RSSI Status is a 3-bit indicator.
            The higher the value of RF RSSI is, the higher is the level of saturation (non-linearity) at the LNA output.

         * To set a regulatory domain with the following configuration:

           * Regulatory domain: US

           Execute the following command:

           .. code-block:: console

              wifi_radio_test reg_domain US

           The sample shows the following output:

           .. code-block:: console

              wifi_radio_test show_config
              reg_domain = US

         .. note::

            The default regulatory domain is ``00`` (world regulatory).

         * To bypass regulatory domain, set ``bypass_reg_domain`` to ``1`` using the following command:

           .. code-block:: console

              wifi_radio_test bypass_reg_domain 1

           The sample shows the following output:

           .. code-block:: console

               wifi_radio_test show_config
               reg_domain = US
               bypass_reg_domain = 1

         .. note::

            Bypass regulatory domain is false by default.

            If ``bypass_reg_domain`` is ``0``, then TX power of the channel will be configured to the minimum value of the user configured TX power value and maximum power supported in the configured regulatory domain.

            If ``bypass_reg_domain`` is ``1``, then user configured TX power value will be set overriding current configured regulatory domain maximum TX power for the channel.
