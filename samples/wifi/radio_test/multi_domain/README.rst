Wi-Fi: Radio test (Multi domain)
################################

The Radio test sample supports the Radio test subcommands and subcommands to program the Factory Information Configuration Registers (FICR) fields defined in the nRF7002 one-time programmable (OTP) memory.
The sample can be run on multiple domains, for example, Wi-Fi® only on the application core or Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® combination mode, where Wi-Fi runs on the application core and Bluetooth runs on the network core.

See the subpages for detailed documentation on the sample and its features.
