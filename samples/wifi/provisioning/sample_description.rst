The Wi-Fi Provisioning Service sample demonstrates how to provision a device with Nordic Semiconductor's Wi-Fi chipsets over BluetoothÂ® Low Energy.

.. _wifi_provisioning_app:

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kit:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

The sample requires a smartphone (configurator) with Nordic Semiconductor's nRF Wi-Fi Provisioner app installed in one of the following versions:

* `nRF Wi-Fi Provisioner mobile app for Android`_
* `nRF Wi-Fi Provisioner mobile app for iOS`_

Overview
********

With this sample, you can provision a Wi-Fi device that lacks input or output capability.
The sample is divided into three parts:

* Task and event handling component: Handles provisioning-related tasks and events.
* Transport layer: Based on Bluetooth Low Energy and exchanges information between the device and the nRF Wi-Fi Provisioner app.
* Configuration management component: Manages the provisioning data (in RAM and flash) accessed by multiple threads.

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/wifi/provisioning`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt

The sample generates header and source files based on protocol buffer definitions in :file:`.proto` files during the build process.
You must install a protocol buffer compiler to generate the files.
See the :ref:`zephyr:nanopb_sample` in the zephyr documentation for more information.

Testing
=======

|test_sample|

1. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal|
#. Observe the following output:

   .. code-block:: console

      wifi_prov: BT Advertising successfully started

#. Open the nRF Wi-Fi Provisioner app.
#. Enable Bluetooth if it is disabled.
#. Search and connect to the device you want to provision.
   If the connection and pairing are established, observe the following output:

   .. code-block:: console

      wifi_prov: BT Connected: <configurator BT address>
      wifi_prov: BT pairing completed: <configurator BT address>, bonded: 0

#. Start an access point scan.
#. Enter the password, if required.
#. Establish a Wi-Fi connection.
#. Observe the following output, if the connection is successful:

   .. code-block:: console

      wpa_supp: wlan0: CTRL-EVENT-CONNECTED - Connection to <AP MAC Address> completed [id=0 id_str=]
