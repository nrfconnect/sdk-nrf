Wi-Fi: Offloaded raw TX
#######################

   :depth: 2

The Offloaded raw TX sample demonstrates how to use the offloaded raw transmit APIs provided by the nRF Wi-Fi driver for transmitting raw packets.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

Overview
********

The sample generates and broadcasts 802.11 beacon frames as raw TX packets.
As a result, the nRF70 Series device can be identified as a Wi-FiÂ® beaconing device.

For more information on the offloaded raw transmit operation, see :ref:`ug_nrf70_developing_offloaded_raw_tx`.

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/wifi/offloaded_raw_tx`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

To build for the nRF7002 DK, use the ``nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp`` board target.
The following is an example of the CLI command:

  .. code-block:: console

     west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp

To generate and transmit beacons, use the following commands:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Generate beacons

      To generate beacons with random source MAC address and BSSID, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: console

	 west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DCONFIG_GENERATE_MAC_ADDRESS=y -DCONFIG_ENTROPY_GENERATOR=y

   .. group-tab:: Transmit beacons

      To transmit beacons at a specified interval, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: console

	 west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DCONFIG_BEACON_INTERVAL=200

Change the board target as given below for the nRF7002 EK.

.. code-block:: console

   west build -p -b nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DSHIELD=nrf7002ek

#. Observe the packets that are sent out, in a sniffer capture, by filtering the packets based on their transmit MAC address or SSID.
