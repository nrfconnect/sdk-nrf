   :depth: 2

The Throughput sample provides a framework for users to measure the achievable IP networking throughput of applications using Nordic Semiconductor's Wi-FiÂ® chipsets.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kit:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

Overview
********

The sample demonstrates how to measure the network throughput of a Nordic Wi-Fi-enabled platform using the **zperf** sample application under the different Wi-Fi stack configuration profiles.
The sample requires additional software, such as the Wi-Fi **iperf** application.
When the sample runs Wi-Fi UDP/TCP throughput in client mode, a peer device runs UDP/TCP throughput in server mode.
When the sample runs Wi-Fi UDP/TCP throughput in server mode, a peer device runs UDP/TCP throughput in client mode.

See :ref:`constrained_host_usage_profiles` for different Wi-Fi stack configuration profiles.
See `Network Traffic Generator`_ for instructions on how to use **zperf** and **iperf** applications.

Test setup
==========

The following figure shows a reference test setup.

     Wi-Fi Throughput sample test setup

The reference test setup shows the connections between the following devices:

* The nRF7002 DK on which the throughput sample runs the **zperf** application.
* Wi-Fi peer device that runs the **iperf** application.

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/wifi/throughput`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

.. note::
   The sample is supported on the nRF7002 DK with QSPI as the interface between the nRF5340 host and the nRF7002 device.

To build for the nRF7002 DK, use the ``nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp`` board target.
The following is an example of the CLI command:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp

To build for the nRF7002 DK with different profiles for Station mode, use the following CLI commands:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: IoT devices

      To build for the nRF7002 DK, with the IoT device profile for Station mode, use the ``iot-devices`` overlay configuration.

      .. code-block:: console

         west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-iot-devices.conf

   .. group-tab:: Memory-optimized

      To build for the nRF7002 DK, with the memory-optimized profile for Station mode, use the ``memory-optimized`` overlay configuration.

      .. code-block:: console

         west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-memory-optimized.conf

   .. group-tab:: High performance

      To build for the nRF7002 DK, with the high performance profile for Station mode, use the ``high-performance`` overlay configuration.

      .. code-block:: console

         west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-high-performance.conf

   .. group-tab:: TX prioritized

      To build for the nRF7002 DK, with the TX prioritized profile for Station mode, use the ``tx-prio`` overlay configuration.

      .. code-block:: console

         west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-tx-prio.conf

   .. group-tab:: RX prioritized

      To build for the nRF7002 DK, with the RX prioritized profile for Station mode, use the ``rx-prio`` overlay configuration.

      .. code-block:: console

         west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-rx-prio.conf

=======

|test_sample|

1. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal|
#. Scan for the Wi-Fi networks in range using the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      wifi scan

   The output should be similar to the following:

   .. code-block:: console
