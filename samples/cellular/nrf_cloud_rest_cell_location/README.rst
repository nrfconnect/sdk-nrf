This sample demonstrates how to use the `nRF Cloud REST API`_ for nRF Cloud's cellular location service on your device.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

The sample requires an `nRF Cloud`_ account.
Your device must be onboarded to nRF Cloud.
If it is not, follow the instructions in `Device on-boarding <nrf_cloud_rest_location_onboarding_>`_.

.. note::
   This sample requires modem firmware v1.3.x or later for an nRF9160 DK, or modem firmware v2.x.x for the nRF91x1 DKs.

Overview
********

After the sample initializes and connects to the network, it enters single-cell mode and sends a single-cell location request to nRF Cloud using network data obtained from the :ref:`modem_info_readme` library.
To enable multi-cell mode, press **Button 1**.
In multi-cell mode, the sample requests for neighbor cell measurement using the :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library.
If neighbor cell data is measured, the sample sends a multi-cell location request to nRF Cloud.
Otherwise, the request is single-cell.
In either mode, the sample sends a new location request if a change in cell ID is detected.

See the `nRF Cloud Location Services documentation`_ for additional information.

Limitations
***********

The sample requires the network carrier to provide date and time to the modem.
Without a valid date and time, the modem cannot generate JWTs with an expiration time.

User interface
**************

Pressing **Button 1** toggles between single-cell and multi-cell mode.

Set the :ref:`CONFIG_REST_CELL_CHANGE_CONFIG <CONFIG_REST_CELL_CHANGE_CONFIG>` Kconfig config value to try all combinations of the :c:struct:`nrf_cloud_location_config` structure values ``hi_conf`` and ``fallback``.

.. _nrf_cloud_rest_location_onboarding:

Onboarding your device to nRF Cloud
***********************************

You must onboard your device to nRF Cloud for this sample to function.
You only need to do this once for each device.
To onboard your device, install `nRF Cloud Utils`_ and follow the instructions in the README.

Configuration
*************
|config|


Configuration options
=====================

Check and configure the following Kconfig options for the sample:

.. _CONFIG_REST_CELL_CHANGE_CONFIG:

CONFIG_REST_CELL_CHANGE_CONFIG - Enable changing request configuration
   Set this to use the next combination of ``hi_conf`` and ``fallback`` flags after performing both single- and multi-cell location requests.

.. _CONFIG_REST_CELL_DEFAULT_DOREPLY_VAL:

CONFIG_REST_CELL_DEFAULT_DOREPLY_VAL - Enable return of location from cloud
   If enabled, request the cloud to return the location information.

.. _CONFIG_REST_CELL_DEFAULT_FALLBACK_VAL:

CONFIG_REST_CELL_DEFAULT_FALLBACK_VAL - Enable fallback to coarse location
   If enabled and the location of the cell tower or Wi-FiÂ® access points cannot be found, return area-level location based on the cellular tracking area code.
   Otherwise an error will be returned indicating location is not known.

.. _CONFIG_REST_CELL_DEFAULT_HICONF_VAL:

CONFIG_REST_CELL_DEFAULT_HICONF_VAL - Enable high confidence result
   Enable a 95% confidence interval for the location, instead of the default 68%.

.. _CONFIG_REST_CELL_SEND_DEVICE_STATUS:

CONFIG_REST_CELL_SEND_DEVICE_STATUS - Send device status
   Send device status to nRF Cloud on initial connection.
