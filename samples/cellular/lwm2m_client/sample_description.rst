   :depth: 2

The LwM2M Client sample demonstrates the usage of the :term:`Lightweight Machine to Machine (LwM2M)` protocol to connect a Thingy:91 or an nRF91 Series DK to an LwM2M server through LTE.
To achieve this, the sample uses the Zephyr's :ref:`lwm2m_interface` client and |NCS| :ref:`lib_lwm2m_client_utils` library.
The former provides a device vendor agnostic client implementation, whereas the latter includes all the Nordic specific bits and pieces.

The sample also supports a proprietary mechanism to fetch location assistance data from `nRF Cloud`_ by proxying it through the LwM2M server.
For this, the sample makes use of the :ref:`lib_lwm2m_location_assistance` library.

Requirements
************

.. _supported boards:

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

Additionally, the sample requires an activated SIM card, and an LwM2M server such as `Leshan Demo Server`_ or AVSystem's `Coiote Device Management`_ server.
To know more about the AVSystem integration with |NCS|, see :ref:`ug_avsystem`.

Overview
********

LwM2M is an application layer protocol based on CoAP over UDP.
It is designed to expose various resources for reading, writing, and executing through an LwM2M server in a very lightweight environment.
The client sends data such as button and switch states, accelerometer data, temperature, and GNSS position to the LwM2M server.
It can also receive activation commands such as buzzer activation and light control.

.. note::
   The GNSS module interferes with the LTE connection.
   If GNSS is not needed or if the device is in an area with poor connection, disable the GNSS module.
   You can disable the GNSS module by setting the configuration option :ref:`CONFIG_APP_GNSS <CONFIG_APP_GNSS>` to ``n``.

.. _state_diagram:

State diagram
=============

The following diagram shows states and transitions for the LwM2M Client:

.. figure:: /images/lwm2m_client_state_diagram.svg
   :alt: LwM2M client state diagram

When the device boots up, the sample first connects to the LTE network and initiates the LwM2M connection.
If there are errors, in most error cases, the sample tries to reconnect the LwM2M client.
In the case of network errors, it tries to reconnect the LTE network.
When the number of retries to restore the network connection exceeds three times, the sample falls back to the bootstrap.
This enables the recovery in the cases where the LwM2M client credentials are outdated or removed from the server.

.. _dtls_support:

DTLS Support
============

The sample has DTLS security enabled by default.
You need to provide the following information to the LwM2M server before you can make a successful connection:

* Client endpoint
* Identity
* `Pre-Shared Key (PSK)`_

See :ref:`server setup <server_setup_lwm2m_client>` for instructions on providing the information to the server.

.. _notifications_lwm2m:

Notifications
=============

LwM2M specifies the Notify operation, which can be used to notify the server of changes to the value of a resource field, for example, the measured value of a temperature sensor.
This allows active monitoring while using minimal bandwidth, as notifications can be sent with the updated values without the need for the server querying the client regularly.

To enable notifications, the server must initiate an observation request on one or more resources of interest.
For more information, see :ref:`notifications_setup_lwm2m`.

.. _sensor_module_lwm2m:

Sensor Module
=============

The sample has a sensor module which, if enabled, reads the selected sensors and updates the client's LwM2M resource values.
Each sensor can be enabled separately.

The sensor module is intended to be used together with notifications.
If notifications are enabled for a Sensor Value resource and the corresponding sensor is enabled in the sensor module, a notification will be sent when the value changes.
The frequency of notification packets is configured by LwM2M attributes set by the server.

See :ref:`sensor_module_options` for information on enabling and configuring the sensor module.

Sensor simulation
=================

If a sensor simulator is defined in devicetree with the ``sensor_sim`` node label, it will be used over real devices.
This is useful, for example, on an nRF91 Series DK, where only simulated sensor data is available, as it does not have any of the external sensors needed for actual measurements.

Configuration
*************

|config|
You can configure the sample either by editing the :file:`prj.conf` file and the relevant overlay files, or through menuconfig or guiconfig.

Setup
=====

Before building and running the sample, complete the following steps:

1. Select the device you plan to test.
#. Select the LwM2M server for testing.
#. Setup the LwM2M server by completing the steps listed in :ref:`server_setup_lwm2m_client`.
   This step retrieves the server address and the security tag that will be needed during the next steps.
#. :ref:`server_addr_PSK`.

.. |dtls_support| replace:: The same credentials must be provided in the :guilabel:`Leshan Demo Server Security configuration` page (see :ref:`dtls_support` for instructions).

.. _server_setup_lwm2m_client:

.. include:: /includes/lwm2m_common_server_setup.txt

.. _server_addr_PSK:

Set the server address and PSK
------------------------------

1. Open :file:`src/prj.conf`.
#. Set :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_CLIENT_UTILS_SERVER` to the correct server URL:

   * For `Leshan Demo Server`_ - ``coaps://leshan.eclipseprojects.io:5684`` (`public Leshan Demo Server`_).
   * For `Coiote Device Management`_ - ``coaps://eu.iot.avsystem.cloud:5684`` (`Coiote Device Management server`_).
   * For `Leshan Bootstrap Demo Server <public Leshan Bootstrap Server Demo_>`_ - ``coaps://leshan.eclipseprojects.io:5784``
   * For Coiote bootstrap server - ``coaps://eu.iot.avsystem.cloud:5694``
#. Set :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_RD_CLIENT_SUPPORT_BOOTSTRAP` if bootstrap is used.
#. Set :ref:`CONFIG_APP_LWM2M_PSK <CONFIG_APP_LWM2M_PSK>` to the hexadecimal representation of the PSK used when registering the device with the server.

.. _notifications_setup_lwm2m:

Enabling notifications
----------------------

Enabling notifications for a resource varies slightly from server to server.
The client must be connected to the server to enable notifications.
Following are the instructions for enabling notifications in the Leshan Demo server and Coiote Device Management server:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Leshan Demo Server

      1. Open the `Leshan Demo Server web UI`_.
      #. Identify your device in the :guilabel:`Clients` tab and select it.
      #. Select the desired object in the menu on the left in the UI.
      #. Identify one or more resources you want to track and click :guilabel:`OBS` next to it.

         * You can track either a single resource or all the resources of an object. It is recommended to track only the resources that are expected to change.
         * If you want to use the :ref:`sensor_module_lwm2m`, at least the Sensor Value resource must be tracked for all sensors enabled in the Sensor Module.

   .. tab:: Coiote Device Management server

      1. Open `Coiote Device Management server`_.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Device inventory` tab in the top.
      #. Identify your device in the list and click on the anchor text corresponding to the device ID in the **Identity** column.
      #. Click the :guilabel:`Objects` tab in the new menu to the left, just below :guilabel:`Dashboard`.
      #. Identify one or more objects that you want to receive notifications from, and expand it by clicking on them.
      #. Identify one or more resources of the object that you want to track:

         * You can track either a single resource or all the resources of an object. It is recommended to track only the resources that are expected to change.
         * If you want to use the :ref:`sensor_module_lwm2m`, at least the Sensor Value resource must be tracked for all sensors enabled in the Sensor Module.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Value Tracking` button of the selected resource.
      #. Select :guilabel:`Observe` or :guilabel:`Monitoring` from the dropdown menu.

         * Selecting :guilabel:`Observe` will only update the Value field of the resource when it receives a notification.
         * Selecting :guilabel:`Monitoring` will additionally create a graph of the logged datapoints.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Limit data usage` to configure how often notifications are sent.

Avoiding re-writing credentials to modem
----------------------------------------

Every time the sample starts, it provisions the keys to the modem and this is only needed once.
To speed up the start up, you can prevent the provisioning by completing the following steps using |VSC|:

1. In |nRFVSC|, `build the sample <How to build an application_>`_.
#. Under **Actions**, click :guilabel:`Kconfig`.
#. Click :guilabel:`Application sample`.
#. Under **LwM2M objects**, remove the key value next to :guilabel:`LwM2M pre-shared key for communication`.
#. Save and close the configuration.

The provisioning can also be prevented by setting the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_APP_LWM2M_PSK` Kconfig option to an empty string in the :file:`prj.conf` file.
You can also edit this configuration using menuconfig.
|config|

For the changes to be added, rebuild the sample.

Configuration for external FOTA
-------------------------------

The sample supports UART2 connection on the nRF9160 SoC to onboard the nRF52840 SoC with or without MCUboot recovery mode.
The nRF9160 SoC needs to enable UART2 on the devicetree using the following configuration files and recovery mode overlay files:

* :file:`overlay-mcumgr_client.conf` - Defines the configuration for external FOTA client.
  This requires an additional devicetree overlay file :file:`nrf9160dk_mcumgr_client_uart2.overlay`.
* :file:`overlay-mcumgr_reset.conf` - Enables MCUboot recovery mode.
  This requires an additional devicetree overlay file :file:`nrf9160dk_recovery.overlay`.

.. _overlay_advanced_fw_object:

To enable the experimental Advanced Firmware Update object for the external FOTA, use the following overlay configuration files:

* :file:`overlay-adv-firmware.conf` - Enables the experimental Advanced Firmware Update object.
* :file:`overlay-lwm2m-1.1.conf` - Enables the LwM2M version 1.1.

You also need one of the following `Coiote Device Management`_ server configurations:

* :file:`overlay-avsystem.conf` - For the `Coiote Device Management`_ server.
* :file:`overlay-avsystem-bootstrap.conf` - For Coiote in bootstrap mode.

.. _build_lwm2m:

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/cellular/lwm2m_client`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

After building and running the sample, you can locate your device in the server:

* Leshan - Devices are listed under **Clients**.
* Coiote - Devices are listed under **Device inventory**.

You can also optionally enable notifications for the resources so that the server actively monitors the resources.

Queue Mode
==========

The sample uses LwM2M queue mode by default.
In this mode, the device need not actively listen for incoming packets and the client can reduce power consumption by being in the sleep state for longer duration.

Queue mode is suitable for LTE connection where devices are not continuously reachable from the network.
Both network and the modem try to release any resources as soon as possible.
In LTE, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol sometimes causes the close of idle connections as early as 10 seconds of idle time.
This depends on the network operator.
Another network dependent feature is the NAT timeout.
Some networks drop unused UDP mappings after 30 seconds even if the RFC recommendation is 2 minutes.
Therefore, after a short sleeping period, the device would not be addressable from the network as the mapping would not exist.
Hence, by default, after contacting the LwM2M server, the device is configured to listen for 10 seconds after receiving the last packet.
After that idle period, the device enables eDRX and PSM power saving modes if those are supported by the network.
The device wakes up from sleep mode when it needs to send data.

Bootstrap support
=================

To successfully run the bootstrap procedure, you must first register the device in the LwM2M bootstrap server.

See :ref:`Registering your device to an LwM2M boot strap server <bootstrap_server_reg>` for instructions.

To build the LwM2M Client with LwM2M bootstrap support, build it with the :file:`overlay-avsystem-bootstrap.conf` or :file:`overlay-leshan-bootstrap.conf` configuration overlays:

   .. tabs::

      .. group-tab:: nRF9161 DK

         .. code-block:: console

            west build -b nrf9161dk_nrf9161_ns -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-leshan-bootstrap.conf

      .. group-tab:: nRF9160 DK

            west build -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-leshan-bootstrap.conf

See :ref:`cmake_options` for instructions on how to add this option.
Keep in mind that the used bootstrap URI is set in the aforementioned configuration file.
In bootstrap mode, application does not overwrite the PSK key from the modem so :ref:`CONFIG_APP_LWM2M_PSK <CONFIG_APP_LWM2M_PSK>` is not used.
Please refer to :ref:`lwm2m_client_provisioning` for instructions how to provision bootstrap keys.

Testing
=======

|test_sample|

   #. |connect_kit|
   #. |connect_terminal|
   #. Observe that the sample starts in the terminal window.
   #. Check that the device is connected to the chosen LwM2M server.
   #. Press **Button 1** on nRF91 Series DK or **SW3** on Thingy:91 and confirm that the button event appears in the terminal.
   #. Check that the button press event has been registered on the LwM2M server by confirming that the press count has been updated.
   #. Retrieve sensor data from various sensors and check if values are reasonable.
   #. Test GNSS module:

      a. Ensure that :ref:`CONFIG_GNSS_PRIORITY_ON_FIRST_FIX <CONFIG_GNSS_PRIORITY_ON_FIRST_FIX>` is enabled.
      #. Ensure that you are in a location with good GNSS signal, preferably outside.
      #. Wait for the GNSS to receive a fix, which will be displayed in the terminal.
         It might take several minutes for the first fix.

   #. Try to enable or disable some sensors in menuconfig and check if the sensors
      appear or disappear correspondingly in the LwM2M server.

.. _lwmwm_client_testing_shell:

Testing with the LwM2M shell
----------------------------

To test the sample using :ref:`lwm2m_shell`, complete the following steps:

.. note::

   To enable any LwM2M v1.1 specific commands (for example, ``LwM2M SEND``), choose any of the v1.1 overlay files.

1. Open a terminal emulator and observe that the development kit produces an output similar to the above section.
#. Verify that the shell inputs are working correctly by running few commands.
   You can, for example, run commands to trigger a registration update, pause and start the client.

   a. Registration update:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ lwm2m update

   #. Pause the client:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ lwm2m pause

   #. Resume the client:

      .. code-block:: console

         uart:~$ lwm2m resume

Firmware Over-the-Air (FOTA)
============================

You can update the firmware of the device if you are using Coiote Device Management server or Leshan server.
Application firmware updates and modem firmware (both full and delta) updates are supported.

To update the firmware, complete the following steps:

   1. Identify the firmware image file to be uploaded to the device. See :ref:`lte_modem` and :ref:`nrf9160_fota` for more information.
   #. Open `Coiote Device Management server`_ and click :guilabel:`LwM2M firmware`.
   #. Click :guilabel:`Schedule new firmware upgrade`.
   #. Click :guilabel:`Upload file` in the bottom left corner and upload the firmware image file.
   #. Configure the necessary firmware update settings in the menu to the right.
   #. Click :guilabel:`Upgrade`.
   #. Observe in the terminal window that the image file is being downloaded.
      The download will take some time.
      If you do not increase the server lifetime, the Coiote server might drop the connection to the device. The device reconnects later.
   #. When the download is complete, the device restarts on its own after installing the firmware.
      Restart the device manually if it has not started automatically.
      The device runs the updated firmware and reconnects to Coiote Device Management server automatically.
