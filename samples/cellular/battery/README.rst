The Battery sample demonstrates how to obtain the following battery related information from the modem of an nRF91 Series DK:

* Modem battery voltage
* Modem battery voltage low level notifications
* Power-off warnings (modem firmware v1.3.1 and higher)

The sample uses the :ref:`modem_battery_readme` library.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

Overview
********

The sample first calls the :c:func:`modem_battery_low_level_handler_set` and :c:func:`modem_battery_pofwarn_handler_set` functions to set the respective handlers, and then sets up the workqueues used to handle the low level battery voltage notifications and the power-off warning notifications.
The sample then initializes the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_modem`.
Next, it enters a state machine that measures the modem battery voltage at every iteration and then executes an activity based on that.
The first activity (:c:func:`init_activity`) sets the modem to *receive-only* mode if the battery voltage drops below the low level threshold or to *normal* mode if it rises above the threshold and updates the state accordingly.

Then, depending on the modem's battery voltage, the modem switches mode according to the following conditions:

* If the modem is in normal mode and the battery voltage drops below the low level threshold, the modem switches to receive-only mode.
* If the modem is in receive-only mode and the battery voltage is below the low level threshold, the application periodically checks the battery voltage and switches state if it rises above the low level threshold.
* If the modem is in receive-only mode and the battery voltage is above the low level threshold, the application executes a connectivity evaluation and if the conditions are either normal (``7``), good (``8``), or excellent (``9``), the modem switches to normal mode.
  When connectivity conditions are poor, the number of packets re-transmitted is higher thus causing an increase in power consumption, which must be avoided when battery voltage is not at an adequately safe level.
  Full connectivity is recommended when battery voltage is at a sufficient level.
* If the modem is in normal mode and the battery voltage is above the low level threshold, the application executes some IP traffic (DNS lookup) to maintain an active LTE connection.
  The modem performs background monitoring of the battery voltage and sends a notification of low level in case it drops below the set threshold.
* If the modem battery voltage drops below the power-off warning level, the modem is automatically set offline by the hardware.
* If the modem battery voltage rises above the power-off warning level, the modem is set to receive-only mode and initialized.

Configuration
*************

|config|

Configuration options
=====================

Check and configure the following configuration options for the sample:

.. _CONFIG_HIGH_BAT_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SEC:

CONFIG_HIGH_BAT_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SEC
   Sets the refresh interval (seconds) when the battery voltage is high.

.. _CONFIG_LOW_BAT_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SEC:

CONFIG_LOW_BAT_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SEC
   Sets the refresh interval (seconds) when the battery voltage is low.

.. _CONFIG_POFWARN_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SEC:

CONFIG_POFWARN_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SEC
   Sets the refresh interval (seconds) after receiving power-off warning.

Testing
=======

|test_sample|

1. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal|
#. Connect the nRF91 Series DK to the `Power Profiler Kit II (PPK2)`_ and set up for external power output.
#. `Install the Power Profiler app`_ in the `nRF Connect for Desktop`_.
#. Connect the Power Profiler Kit II (PPK2) to the PC using a micro-USB cable and `connect to it using the App <Using the Power Profiler app_>`_.
#. Power on or reset your nRF91 Series DK.
#. Observe that the sample starts, initializes the modem, and changes functional mode depending on the external voltage.
