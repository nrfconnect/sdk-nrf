This sample demonstrates how to use the `nRF Cloud CoAP API`_ for nRF Cloud's cellular location service on your device.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

The sample requires an `nRF Cloud`_ account.
Your device must be onboarded to nRF Cloud.
If it is not, follow the instructions in `Device on-boarding <nrf_cloud_coap_cell_location_onboarding>`_.

.. note::
   This sample requires modem firmware v1.3.x or later for an nRF9160 DK, or modem firmware v2.x.x for the nRF9161 and nRF9151 DKs.

Overview
********

The sample can work in two modes: single-cell mode and multi-cell mode.

After the sample initializes and connects to the network, it enters the single-cell mode and sends a single-cell location request to nRF Cloud.
For this purpose, the sample uses network data obtained from the :ref:`modem_info_readme` library.
In the multi-cell mode, the sample requests for neighbor cell measurement using the :ref:`lte_lc_readme` library.

If the modem provides neighbor cell data, the sample sends a multi-cell location request to nRF Cloud.
Otherwise, the request is single-cell.

In either mode, the sample sends a new location request if a change in cell ID is detected.

See the `nRF Cloud Location Services documentation`_ for additional information.

User interface
**************

Button 1:
   Toggle between the single-cell and multi-cell mode.

Setup
=====

You must onboard your device to nRF Cloud for this sample to function.
You only need to do this once for each device.
To onboard your device, install `nRF Cloud Utils`_ and follow the instructions in the README.

Configuration
*************

|config|

Configuration options
=====================

Check and configure the following Kconfig options for the sample:

.. _CONFIG_COAP_CELL_CHANGE_CONFIG:

CONFIG_COAP_CELL_CHANGE_CONFIG - Enable changing request configuration
   Set this to use the next combination of ``hi_conf`` and ``fallback`` flags after performing both single- and multi-cell location requests.

.. _CONFIG_COAP_CELL_DEFAULT_DOREPLY_VAL:

CONFIG_COAP_CELL_DEFAULT_DOREPLY_VAL - Enable return of location from cloud
   If enabled, request the cloud to return the location information.

.. _CONFIG_COAP_CELL_DEFAULT_FALLBACK_VAL:

CONFIG_COAP_CELL_DEFAULT_FALLBACK_VAL - Enable fallback to coarse location
   If enabled and the location of the cell tower or Wi-Fi® access points cannot be found, return area-level location based on the cellular tracking area code.
   Otherwise an error will be returned indicating location is not known.

.. _CONFIG_COAP_CELL_DEFAULT_HICONF_VAL:

CONFIG_COAP_CELL_DEFAULT_HICONF_VAL - Enable high-confidence result
   Enable a 95% confidence interval for the location, instead of the default 68%.

.. _CONFIG_COAP_CELL_SEND_DEVICE_STATUS:

CONFIG_COAP_CELL_SEND_DEVICE_STATUS - Send device status
   Send device status to nRF Cloud on initial connection.

#. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal|
#. Reset the development kit.
#. Observe in the terminal window that the application starts.
   This is indicated by output similar to the following (there is also a lot of additional information about the LTE connection):

Troubleshooting
===============

If you are not getting the output similar to the one in `Testing`_, check the following potential issues:

The network carrier does not provide date and time
   The sample requires the network carrier to provide date and time to the modem.
   Without a valid date and time, the modem cannot generate JWTs with an expiration time.

Dependencies
************

This sample uses the following |NCS| libraries:

* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud`
* :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_coap`
* :ref:`lib_modem_jwt`
* :ref:`lte_lc_readme`
* :ref:`modem_info_readme`
* :ref:`dk_buttons_and_leds_readme`

In addition, it uses the following secure firmware component:

* :ref:`Trusted Firmware-M <ug_tfm>`
