config REST_DEVICE_MESSAGE_DO_JITP
	bool "Ask to perform just-in-time provisioning (JITP) via REST on startup"
	help
	  If a device has JITP certificates and has not yet been provisioned to
	  nRF Cloud, enable this option and press the configured button when
	  prompted after the sample starts.

config REST_DEVICE_MESSAGE_KEEP_ALIVE
	bool "Keep connection alive during button handling"
	default y
	help
	  Keep the HTTP connection open after sending the button message so the
	  direct logging message can reuse it. This reduces data and power
	  consumption, but is not compatible with the cloud logging backend.

config SEND_ONLINE_ALERT
	bool "Sends a routine ALERT_TYPE_DEVICE_NOW_ONLINE on startup"
	help
	  Enable this to demonstrate the alert feature of nRF Cloud. Reception of this alert
	  indicates the device has rebooted.
