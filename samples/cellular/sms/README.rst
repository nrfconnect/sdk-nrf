The SMS sample demonstrates how you can send and receive SMS messages with your nRF91 Series device.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

Overview
********

The SMS sample registers your nRF91 Series device for SMS service within the nRF91 Series modem using the :ref:`sms_readme` library.
The sample requires an LTE connection.

When the sample starts, it sends an SMS if a recipient phone number is set in the configuration.
The sample then receives all the SMS messages and displays the information about the messages including the text that is sent.

Configuration

Additional configuration
========================

Check and configure the following mandatory library options that are used by the sample:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SMS`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB`

Check and configure the following optional library options that are used by the sample:

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

1. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal|
#. Observe that the sample shows the :ref:`UART output <sms_uart_output>` from the device.
   Note that this is an example, and the output need not be identical to your observed output.
#. Send an SMS message to the number associated with the SIM card that you have placed into your nRF91 Series device.

   .. note::

      Not all IoT SIM cards support SMS service. You must check with your operator if the SMS service does not work as expected.
