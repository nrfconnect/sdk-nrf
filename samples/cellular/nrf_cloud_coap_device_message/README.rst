The nRF Cloud CoAP device message sample demonstrates how to use the `nRF Cloud CoAP API`_ to send `device messages <nRF Cloud Device Messages_>`_.
Every button press sends a message to nRF Cloud.

It also demonstrates the use of the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_alert` and :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_log` libraries.
The sample sends an alert when the device first comes online.
It also sends a log message indicating the sample version when the button is pressed.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

The sample requires an `nRF Cloud`_ account.

Your device must be onboarded with `nRF Cloud`_.
If it is not, follow the instructions in `Device on-boarding <nrf_cloud_coap_device_message_onboarding_>`_.

.. note::
   This sample requires modem firmware v1.3.x or later for an nRF9160 DK, or modem firmware v2.x.x for the nRF9161 and nRF9151 DKs.

User interface
**************

Button 1:
   Press to send a device message to nRF Cloud.

LED 1:
   Indicates that the device is connected to LTE and is ready to send messages.

LED 2:
   Indicates that a message is being sent to nRF Cloud.

Setup
=====

You must onboard your device to nRF Cloud for this sample to function.
You only need to do this once for each device.

To onboard your device, install `nRF Cloud Utils`_ and follow the instructions in the README.

Configuration options
=====================

.. include:: /libraries/modem/nrf_modem_lib/nrf_modem_lib_trace.rst
   :start-after: modem_lib_sending_traces_UART_start
   :end-before: modem_lib_sending_traces_UART_end

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/cellular/nrf_cloud_coap_device_message`

Testing
=======

|test_sample|

#. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal|
#. Reset the development kit.
#. Observe in the terminal window that the application starts.
   This is indicated by output similar to the following (there is also a lot of additional information about the LTE connection):

Troubleshooting
===============

If you are not getting the output similar to the one in `Testing`_, check the following potential issue:

The network carrier does not provide date and time
   The sample requires the network carrier to provide date and time to the modem.
   Without a valid date and time, the modem cannot generate JWTs with an expiration time.

nRF Cloud logging
=================

To enable `Zephyr Logging`_ in nRF Cloud using the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud_log` library, add the following parameter to your build command:

``-DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=nrfcloud_logging.conf``

This KConfig fragment allows the sample and various subsystems that have logging enabled to send their logs to nRF Cloud.
Set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_CLOUD_LOG_OUTPUT_LEVEL` option to the log level of messages to be sent to nRF Cloud, such as ``4`` for debug log messages.

Querying device messages over REST API
**************************************

To query the device messages received by the `nRF Cloud`_ backend, send a GET request to the `ListMessages <nRF Cloud REST API ListMessages_>`_ endpoint.
