Radio Test
##########

The Radio Test sample demonstrates how to configure the radio in a specific mode and then test its performance.
The sample provides a set of predefined commands that allow you to configure the radio in three modes:

* Constant RX or TX carrier
* Modulated TX carrier
* RX or TX sweep

Overview
********

You can run the tests by connecting to the board through the serial port and sending shell commands.
Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:shell_api` module is used to handle the commands.
At any time during the tests, you can dynamically set the radio parameters, such as output power, bit rate, and channel.
In sweep mode, you can set the time for which the radio scans each channel from 1 millisecond to 99 milliseconds, in steps of 1 millisecond.
The sample also allows you to send a data pattern to another board.

The sample starts with enabling the high frequency crystal oscillator and configuring the shell.
You can then start running commands to set up and control the radio.
See :ref:`radio_test_ui` for a list of available commands.

.. note::
   For the IEEE 802.15.4 mode, the start channel and the end channel must be within the channel range of 11 to 26.
   Use the ``start_channel`` and ``end_channel`` commands to control this setting.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. include:: /includes/boardname_tables/sample_boardnames.txt
   :start-after: set4_start
   :end-before: set4_end

You can use any one of the development kits listed above.

.. note::
   On nRF5340 DK, the sample is designed to run on the network core.

The sample also requires one of the following testing devices:

  * Another board with the same sample.
    See :ref:`radio_test_testing_board`.
  * Another board connected to a PC with RSSI Viewer application (available in the `nRF Connect for Desktop`_).
    See :ref:`radio_test_testing_rssi`.

.. note::
   The radio test can be also performed using a spectrum analyzer.
   This method of testing is not covered by this documentation.

Building and running
********************
.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/peripheral/radio_test`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt

.. note::
   On the |nRF5340DKnoref|, the Radio Test sample is a standalone network sample that does not require any counterpart application sample.
   However, you must still program the application core to boot up the network core.
   You can use any sample for this, for example :ref:`nrf5340_empty_app_core`.

.. _radio_test_testing:

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your board, you can test it in one of two ways.

.. note::
   For the |nRF5340DKnoref|, see :ref:`logging_cpunet` for information on how to make the PC terminal work with the network core.

.. _radio_test_testing_board:

Testing with another board
--------------------------

1. Connect both boards to the computer using a USB cable.
   The boards are assigned a COM port (Windows) or ttyACM device (Linux), which is visible in the Device Manager.
#. |connect_terminal_both|
#. Run the following commands on one of the boards:
   #. Set the data rate with the ``data_rate`` command to ``ble_2Mbit``.
   #. Set the transmission pattern with the ``transmit_pattern`` command to ``pattern_11110000``.
   #. Set the radio channel with the ``start_channel`` command to 40.
#. Repeat all steps for the second board.
#. On both boards, run the ``parameters_print`` command to confirm that the radio configuration is the same on both boards.
#. Set one board in the Modulated TX Carrier mode using the ``start_tx_modulated_carrier`` command.
#. Set the other board in the RX Carrier mode using the ``start_rx`` command.
#. Print the received data with the ``print_rx`` command and confirm that they match the transmission pattern (0xF0).

.. _radio_test_testing_rssi:

Testing with RSSI Viewer
------------------------

1. Connect the board to the computer using a USB cable.
   The board is assigned a COM port (Windows) or ttyACM device (Linux), which is visible in the Device Manager.
#. |connect_terminal|
#. Set the start channel with the ``start_channel`` command to 20.
#. Set the end channel with the ``end_channel`` command to 60.
#. Set the time on channel with the ``time_on_channel`` command to 50ms.
#. Set the board in the TX sweep mode using the ``start_tx_sweep`` command.
#. Start the RSSI Viewer application and select the board to communicate with.
#. On the application chart, observe the TX sweep in the form of a wave that starts at 2420 MHz frequency and ends with 2480MHz.
