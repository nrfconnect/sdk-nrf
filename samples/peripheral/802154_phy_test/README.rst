IEEE 802.15.4 PHY Test Tool provides a solution for performing Zigbee RF Performance and PHY Certification tests, as well as general evaluation of the integrated radio with IEEE 802.15.4 standard.

Overview
********

You can perform testing by connecting to the development kit through the serial port and sending supported commands.

See :ref:`802154_phy_test_ui` for a list of available commands.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpunet, nrf52840dk_nrf52840

You can use any one of the development kits listed above.

Conducting tests using the sample also requires a testing device, such as:

  * Another development kit with the same sample, set into DUT mode.
    See :ref:`802154_phy_test_testing_board`.

.. note::
   You can perform the testing using other equipment, such as a spectrum analyzer, oscilloscope, RF power meter, etc.
   This method of testing is not covered by this documentation.

Building and running
********************
.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/peripheral/802154_phy_test`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt

.. note::
   On the |nRF5340DKnoref|, the IEEE 802.15.4 PHY Test Tool is a standalone network sample that does not require any counterpart application sample.
   However, you must still program the application core to boot up the network core (and forward UART pins to the network core of the CMD device).
   The :ref:`nrf5340_empty_app_core`, which accomplishes both, is built and programmed automatically by default.

.. _802154_phy_test_testing:

Using the tool
==============

After programming the supported development kit of your choice with the sample, you can verify that it functions as expected and begin performing tests.

.. _802154_phy_test_testing_check:

.. note::
   The sample doesn't implement serial echo, and the timeout for receiving the entire command after receiving its first character is very short.
   Thus, commands cannot be sent character-by-character manually. For the commands to be received by the device properly, use a terminal application which supports `line mode`, or send entire commands using `echo`, `printf`, etc.

Checking if the sample works as expected
----------------------------------------

1. Connect the development kit to the computer using a USB cable. Use the DK's programmer USB port (J2).
   The kits are assigned a COM port (Windows) or ttyACM device (Linux), which should be now visible in the Device Manager or /dev directory.
#. Connect to the DK using a terminal emulator (for example, PuTTY or minicom), with the following settings:

    - Baudrate: 115200
    - Parity bits: none
    - Stop bits: 1

#. If the sample is configured to support BOTH modes (the default setting), switch the DK into CMD mode by sending the following command:

    - ``custom changemode 1``

#. On the bottom side of your DK, locate a table describing GPIO pin assignment to LEDs. Read the number of GPIO pin assigned to LED 1, 2, 3 or 4. For example, on nRF52840DK, the LEDs are controlled by pins from P0.13 through P0.16.
#. The LEDs on nRF5340DK and nRF52840DK are in ``sink`` configuration. In order to turn them on, you need to set the respective pin's state to low in order to let the current flow through the LED. Send the following command to the device:

    - ``custom lsetgpio <pin> 0`` where ``<pin>`` is the number of the pin assigned for selected LED.
    - ``custom lsetgpio 28 0`` would be the proper command to light up LED 1 on nRF5340DK.

#. If the selected LED lights up, the sample works as expected and is redy for use.

.. _802154_phy_test_testing_board:

Performing radio tests without serial interface
-----------------------------------------------

1. Make sure that at least one of the development kits can be set into CMD mode, and the other one to the DUT mode. DUT device will not initialize serial interface. The easiest way to achieve this is to flash both devices with the cample configured to support BOTH modes (default setting).
#. Connect both development kits to the computer using a USB cable.
   The kits are assigned a COM port (Windows) or ttyACM device (Linux), which should be now visible in the Device Manager or /dev directory.
#. Connect to the DKs using a terminal emulator (for example, PuTTY or minicom), with the following settings:

    - Baudrate: 115200
    - Parity bits: none
    - Stop bits: 1

#. If the samples are configured to support BOTH modes (the default setting), switch one of the DKs into CMD mode by sending the following command:

    - ``custom changemode 1``

#. Run the following command on the CMD kit:

    - ``custom find``

#. The CMD kit should respond with

    - ``channel <ch> find <ack>`` if the CMD device successfully communicates with the DUT device
    - ``DUT NOT FOUND`` if it couldn't exchange packets with the DUT device

#. Please refer to :ref:`802154_phy_test_ui` for the complete list of available commands.
