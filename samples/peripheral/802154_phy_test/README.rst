The IEEE 802.15.4 PHY test tool performs 802.15.4 RF Performance and PHY Certification tests, and can also provide information for a general evaluation of the performance of the integrated 802.15.4 radio.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

Conducting tests using the sample also requires a testing device, like another development kit running the same sample, set into DUT mode.
For more information, see :ref:`802154_phy_test_testing`.

.. note::
   You can perform the testing using other equipment, like spectrum analyzers, oscilloscopes, or RF power meters, but these methods are not covered by this documentation.

Overview
********

To perform the tests, connect to the development kit through the serial port and send supported commands.

See the :ref:`802154_phy_test_ui` for the list of the available commands.

*************

|config|

FEM support
===========

.. include:: /includes/sample_fem_support.txt

   To enable the feature, set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PTT_ANTENNA_DIVERSITY` option as ``enabled``.


Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/peripheral/802154_phy_test`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt

.. note::
   On the |nRF5340DKnoref|, the IEEE 802.15.4 PHY Test Tool sample is designed to run on the network core and requires the :ref:`nrf5340_remote_shell` running on the application core.
   This sample uses the :ref:`shell_ipc_readme` library to forward shell data through the physical UART interface of the application core.
   The Remote IPC shell sample is built and programmed automatically by default.

.. _802154_phy_test_testing:

Testing the sample
==================

After programming the sample to your development kit, complete the following steps to test it:

1. Connect the development kit to the computer using a USB cable.
   Use the development kit's programmer USB port (J2).
   The kits are assigned a COM port (in Windows) or a ttyACM device (in Linux), visible in the Device Manager or in the :file:`/dev` directory.
#. |connect_terminal|
#. If the sample is configured to support both modes (the default setting), switch the development kit into CMD mode by sending the following command:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      custom changemode *1*

#. On the bottom side of your development kit, locate the table describing the GPIO pin assignment to the LEDs.
#. Read the numbers of the GPIO pins assigned to LED 1, 2, 3 or 4.

   For example, on the nRF52840DK, the LEDs are controlled by the pins ranging between P0.13 and P0.16.
   The LEDs on nRF5340DK and nRF52840DK are in the ``sink`` configuration.

#. To turn the LEDs on, set the respective pin's state to low to let the current flow through the LED, using the ``custom lsetgpio <pin> 0`` command, where ``<pin>`` is the number of the pin assigned for selected LED.

   See the following example for how to light up LED 1 on the nRF5340DK:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      custom lsetgpio *28* 0

If the selected LED lights up, the sample works as expected and is ready for use.

.. _802154_phy_test_testing_board:

Performing radio tests without the serial interface
===================================================

1. Make sure that at least one of the development kits can be set into CMD mode and the other one to the DUT mode.

   The DUT device does not initialize the serial interface.
   The easiest way to achieve this is to flash both devices with the sample configured to support both modes (default setting).
#. Connect both development kits to the computer using a USB cable.

   The kits are assigned a COM port (in Windows) or a ttyACM device (in Linux), visible in the Device Manager or the :file:`/dev` directory.
#. |connect_terminal|
#. If the samples are configured to support both modes (the default setting), switch one of the development kits into CMD mode by sending the following command:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      custom changemode *1*

#. Run the following command on the development kit running in CMD mode:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      custom find

#. The development kit running in CMD mode should respond with one of the following two responses:

    * ``channel <ch> find <ack>`` - if the CMD device successfully communicates with the DUT device.
    * ``DUT NOT FOUND`` - if it could not exchange packets with the DUT device.

Refer to the :ref:`802154_phy_test_ui` for the complete list of the available commands.
