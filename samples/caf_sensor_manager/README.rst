CAF: Sensor manager

The sensor manager sample demonstrates the functionality of the :ref:`caf_sensor_manager`.
It uses the :ref:`sensor_sim`, the sensor manager module, the :ref:`caf_sensor_data_aggregator`, and the workload simulator module to automatically sample and gather data and then receive and process it in packages.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

   :rows: nrf52840dk_nrf52840

Overview
********

The sample provides simulated input data using :ref:`sensor_sim`.
The input data simulates acceleration in X, Y, and Z axes, with the acceleration generated as value of a periodic wave signal.
Whenever new data is generated, the :ref:`caf_sensor_manager` generates the appropriate :c:struct:`sensor_event` instances that include the generated data.

The data from the events is then passed to the :ref:`caf_sensor_data_aggregator`.
When the aggregator's buffer is full, the application sends aggregated data to the workload simulator module (``workload_sim``).
The workload simulator is a custom module used by this sample only.
This module handles the data received from the :ref:`caf_sensor_data_aggregator`, simulates workload on data using :c:func:`k_busy_wait` and notifies the aggregator module when the aggregator buffer can be freed.

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

1. |connect_terminal|
#. Reset the kit.
#. Observe that output similar to the following is logged on UART:
