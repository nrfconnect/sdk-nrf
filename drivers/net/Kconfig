# Ethernet over RTT driver configuration options

if HAS_SEGGER_RTT

menuconfig ETH_RTT
	select USE_SEGGER_RTT
	select NET_L2_ETHERNET
	bool "Ethernet over RTT driver"
	help
	  This option enables network interface driver that sends and receives
	  ethernet frames over RTT channel. The driver is intended primary for
	  debugging and testing.

if ETH_RTT

config ETH_RTT_DRV_NAME
	string "Ethernet over RTT driver name"
	default "eth_rtt"
	help
	  This option sets the driver name.

config ETH_RTT_MAC_ADDR
	string "MAC address for the interface"
	default ""
	help
	  Specify a MAC address for the Ethernet over RTT network interface
	  in the form of hex 8-bit chars separated by colons
	  (e.g.: aa:33:cc:22:e2:c0). The default is an empty string, which
	  selects random address (00:00:5E:00:53:xx) according to RFC 7042.

config ETH_RTT_CHANNEL
	int "RTT channel number"
	default 2
	help
	  Sets RTT channel that will be used to transfer ethernet frames in
	  both directions. Channels 0 and 1 have special purpose defined by
	  SEGGER, so it is safer to use channel 2 or above. This number must be
	  smaller than SEGGER_RTT_MAX_NUM_UP_BUFFERS and cannot be used by any
	  other module.

config ETH_RTT_UP_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "RTT up buffer size"
	default 256 if SOC_NRF52810 || SOC_SERIES_NRF51X
	default 1024 if SOC_NRF52832
	default 3072
	range 16 1048576
	help
	  Sets RTT buffer size for sending ethernet frames. Smaller values will
	  save the RAM, but will decrease the performance.

config ETH_RTT_DOWN_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "RTT down buffer size"
	default 128 if SOC_NRF52810 || SOC_SERIES_NRF51X
	default 512 if SOC_NRF52832
	default 3072
	range 16 1048576
	help
	  Sets RTT buffer size for receiving ethernet frames. Smaller values
	  will save the RAM, but will decrease the performance.

config ETH_RTT_MTU
	int "Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)"
	default 1500
	range 68 65536
	help
	  Sets the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for the Ethernet over RTT
	  network interface. Ethernet default is 1500 and using different value
	  may cause unpredictable behavior. Change this value only if you
	  really known what you are doing. IPv4 requires at least 68 and IPv6
	  requires at least 1280.

config ETH_POLL_PERIOD_MS
	int "Receive polling period (ms)"
	default 25
	range 1 200
	help
	  RTT has no interrupt, so read have to be done using polling. This
	  option sets time in milliseconds between two consecutive RTT read
	  attempts when there is no input transfer for some time. When transfer
	  is currently running ETH_POLL_ACTIVE_PERIOD_MS is used instead.

config ETH_POLL_ACTIVE_PERIOD_MS
	int "Receive polling period when transfer is running (ms)"
	default 5
	range 1 ETH_POLL_PERIOD_MS
	help
	  This option sets time in milliseconds between two consecutive RTT
	  read attempts when input transfer is running. When transfer stopped
	  some time ago driver will use ETH_POLL_PERIOD_MS again.

config ETH_RTT_DEBUG_HEX_DUMP
	bool "Print hex dumps"
	depends on ETH_RTT_LOG_LEVEL >= 4
	help
	  Enabling this option prints out hex dumps of transferred data. There
	  are four types of hex dumps: data that flows from RTT, data that
	  flows to RTT, frames that are passed to network stack, frames that
	  are get from network stack. This option will produce a lot of debug
	  logs, so if you reading it make sure that logger did not discard
	  something because of buffer overrun.
