	  Max time to write one block into non-volatile storage (in microseconds).
	  The block size is dependent on non-volatile storage type and is 4
	  bytes for flash and 16 bytes for RRAM. The value is dependent on the
	  chip used, and should be checked against the chip's datasheet.
	  For RRAM-based flash drivers, data is written in blocks of 16 bytes
	  over buffered writing. This value is used to calculate the time to
	  write one 16-byte block.

	   Max time to prepare the store process (in microseconds). If used
	   together with SETTINGS this value has to be at least as long as the
	   time to erase one page (ERASEPAGE). If used together with
	   SOC_FLASH_NRF_PARTIAL_ERASE this value should be
	   (SOC_FLASH_NRF_PARTIAL_ERASE_MS * 1000 * 3). This is to account for
	   worst case scenario, before starting storing entries. This value
	   is dependent on the chip used, and should be checked against the chip
	   datasheet.
	   For RRAM-based persistent memory driver, use ERASEPROTECT and disregard the SOC_FLASH_NRF_PARTIAL_ERASE_MS parameter.
