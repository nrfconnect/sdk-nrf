	  Maximum number of allowed metadata scanning failures on partition
	  before giving up. The option should be tradeoff between
	  performance and reliability. If the value is too low, the system
	  may not take into account all the candidates, and may not select
	  the best one for recovery. If the value is too high, the system
	  may take too long to scan the partition, and may not be able to
	  recover in time. The value should be set to the number of
	  expected failures during the scanning process.

	  Max time to write one word into non-volatile storage (in microseconds).
	  The word size is 4 bytes. The value is dependent on the
	  chip used, and should be checked against the chip's datasheet.
	  For RRAM-based flash driver the average time to write a 32-bit word
	  in a stream of sequentially address ordered writes was taken.

	  Note that despite the typical time for streamed writing of a 32-bit word
	  for RRAM is 22 microseconds the actual time may vary. It is used a bit bigger
	  value here to compensate dispersion around the typical time.
