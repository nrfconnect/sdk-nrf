config EMDS_SECTOR_COUNT
	int "Sector count of the emergency data storage area"
	default 1
	help
	  Number of sectors used for the emergency data storage area

config EMDS_THREAD_STACK_SIZE
	int "Stack size for the emergency data storage thread"
	default 500
	help
	  Size of the stack that is initialized by the emergency data storage

config EMDS_THREAD_PRIORITY
	int "Priority for the emergency data storage thread"
	default 0
	help
	  Cooperative priority for the emergency data storage thread. This will
	  be used through K_PRIO_COOP(x), that means higher value gives lower
	  priority.

config EMDS_FLASH_TIME_WRITE_ONE_WORD_US
	int "Time to write one word into flash"
	default 41
	help
	  Max time to write one word (4 bytes) in flash (in microseconds). This
	  value is dependent on the chip used, and should be checked against the
	  chip datasheet.

config EMDS_FLASH_TIME_ENTRY_OVERHEAD_US
	int "Time to schedule write of one entry"
	default 300
	help
	   Max time to prepare the write of each entry (in microseconds).

	default 9000 if SETTINGS && SOC_FLASH_NRF_PARTIAL_ERASE
	default 500
	help
	   Max time to prepare the store process (in microseconds). If used
	   together with SETTINGS this value has to be at least as long as the
	   time to erase one page (ERASEPAGE). If used together with
	   SOC_FLASH_NRF_PARTIAL_ERASE this value should be
	   (SOC_FLASH_NRF_PARTIAL_ERASE_MS * 1000 * 3). This is to account for
	   worst case scenario, before starting storing entries. This value
	   is dependent on the chip used, and should be checked against the chip
	   datasheet.
