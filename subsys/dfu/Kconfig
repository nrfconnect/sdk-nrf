	help
	  Set the timeout in seconds for how long the code will wait when
	  reading DFU_ERASE_PENDING from the modem. If the timeout is reached
	  an DFU_TARGET_EVT_TIMEOUT is issued and a disconnect of the LTE link
	  is recommended so that the modem has time to service the
	  DFU_ERASE_PENDING request. It's also possible to reboot the device to
	  achive the same desired behavior.
