config DFU_MULTI_IMAGE_MAX_IMAGE_COUNT

	  The maximum number of images that can be included in a DFU package
	  and correctly processed by the DFU Multi Image library.

config DFU_MULTI_IMAGE_SAVE_PROGRESS
	bool "Store dfu multi image write progress to flash stream"

	help
	  Enable this option to cause dfu_multi_image to store the current
	  write progress to flash. In case of power failure or device reset,
	  the operation can then resume from the latest state.

config DFU_MULTI_IMAGE_ALIGN
	int "DFU Multi Image start of images alignment"
	default $(dt_node_int_prop_int,$(DT_CHOSEN_ZEPHYR_FLASH),write-block-size)
	help
	  Set the alignment of the start of every image inside the DFU Multi Image package.
	  Setting this to a value greater than 1 will add 0xFF padding at the end of the header
	  and between images as needed to ensure that each image starts at an offset with the given alignment.
	  This is needed when the DFU package is stored in a medium that requires specific alignment,
	  e.g., flash memory with minimum write size of 4.
	  Note - the additional 0xFF will be passed as part of the image to the underlying DFU target
	  and possibly will be written to the NVM.
