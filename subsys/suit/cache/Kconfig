		If this option is set then after the SUIT envelope is stored (more
		precisely: when calling the suit_dfu_cache_rw_initialize function)
		then Cache0 will be erased and reinitialized regardless of its previous
		state. If this option is not set, the SUIT subsystem will check the
		partition and only erase it if its broken and needs recovery.
		If this option is not set it is up to the user to ensure that the
		contents of cache0 are appropriate after the envelope is stored.
