	default 1000
	help
	  The option specifies a timeout value that MPSL clock control integration layer
	  will wait for completion of a request put to a clock driver. Note that the value
	  depends on the clock driver used, for example if nrf2 clock driver is used,
	  it must be greater or equalt than internal clock driver timeout value.

	default y
	help
	  This option enables MPSL to request a clock for non-volatile memory,
	  ensuring it operates at a frequency that prevents code execution being
	  too slow. This is crucial to meet meet radio protocols requirements.

config MPSL_EXT_CLK_CTRL_LFCLK_REQ_TIMEOUT_ALLOW
	bool "Workaround for LFCLK request timeout"
	depends on SOC_SERIES_NRF54H
	default y
	help
	  This option enables a workaround in MPSL external clock control
	  integration layer, to ignore the -NRF_ETIMEDOUT response for LFCLK
	  request. This workaround is safe to use for cases where there is no
	  other clock requests in the radio core FW or available requests are
	  for a clock with better accuracy than the one requested by the MPSL.
	  It is user responsibility to make sure these requirements are fulfilled.
