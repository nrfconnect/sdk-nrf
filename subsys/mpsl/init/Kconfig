config MPSL_THREAD_COOP_PRIO
	int
	default 0 if NET_L2_OPENTHREAD
	default BT_CTLR_SDC_RX_PRIO if BT_LL_SOFTDEVICE
	default 8

config NRF52_ANOMALY_109_WORKAROUND_EGU_INSTANCE
	int
	depends on NRF52_ANOMALY_109_WORKAROUND
	default 4
	help
	  Update default EGU instance used by the nRF52 Anomaly 109 workaround
	  for PWM. The EGU instance 5 is used by the MPSL.

config MPSL_WORK_STACK_SIZE
	int "Size of the work handler thread stack"
	default 1024
	help
	  Size of the work handler thread stack, used to process work in MPSL
	  low priority context.

config MPSL_TIMESLOT_SESSION_COUNT
	int "Number of timeslot sessions"
	default 0
	help
	  Maximum number of timeslot sessions.

config MPSL_ASSERT_HANDLER
	bool "Application defined assertion handler"
	help
	  This option enables an application-defined sink for the
	  MPSL assertion mechanism. This must be defined in
	  application code and will be invoked whenever the
	  MPSL code encounters an unrecoverable error.

config MPSL_DYNAMIC_INTERRUPTS
	bool "Use direct dynamic interrupts for MPSL IRQ handlers"
	depends on DYNAMIC_DIRECT_INTERRUPTS
	help
	  This option configures MPSL IRQ handlers using direct dynamic
	  interrupts. This allows reconfiguring TIMER0_IRQn, RTC0_IRQn,
	  and RADIO_IRQn handlers during runtime when MPSL is uninitialized.

config MPSL_TRIGGER_IPC_TASK_ON_RTC_START
	bool "Trigger an IPC task when the RTC starts"
	depends on SOC_NRF5340_CPUNET
	help
	  This option configures MPSL to trigger an IPC task at the time the
	  RTC starts. This can be used for synchronizing time betwen the
	  application and network core.

config MPSL_TRIGGER_IPC_TASK_ON_RTC_START_CHANNEL
	int "IPC channel to trigger on IPC start"
	depends on MPSL_TRIGGER_IPC_TASK_ON_RTC_START
	default 4
	help
	  The channel that will be triggered when the RTC starts.
	  The application core part of the code needs to be aware of
	  which channel is used.

config MPSL_LOW_PRIO_IRQN
	int
	default 25 if SOC_COMPATIBLE_NRF52X # SWI5
	default 26 if SOC_COMPATIBLE_NRF53X # SWI0
	default 404 if SOC_SERIES_NRF54HX # QDEC130
	default 28 if SOC_COMPATIBLE_NRF54LX # SWI00
	help
	  This option sets the low priority interrupt that MPSL will use.
	  Check the interrupt number in the MDK

config MPSL_HFCLK_LATENCY
	int
	default 854 if SOC_SERIES_NRF54LX
	default 1400
	help
	  This option configures the amount of time MPSL will assume it takes
	  for the HFCLK to be available after it's requested.
	  Lowering this value will improve power consumption.
	  Making this value too small can degrade BLE performance.
	  In order to configure this value effectively, there are several considerations.
	  This value needs to include the startup time of the HFXO, which will depend on various
	  factors including the crystal itself, load capacitors, ESR,
	  operating conditions, variations in bias voltage, etc. For complete information
	  about the startup time for the HFXO in use, consult the relevant datasheet
	  or contact the crystal vendor. Recommended load capacitances are
	  given in the nordic product specifications.
	  Additionally, depending on the product, a debounce period may be implemented
	  in the nordic chip before the HFXO is considered available.
	  For the nRF52 Series this is configured by the HFXODEBOUNCE register in
	  the CLOCK peripheral. For the nRF53 Series application core it's
	  configured by the HFXOCNT register in the UICR.

config MPSL_CALIBRATION_PERIOD
	int "Calibration callback period in milliseconds"
	depends on (SOC_SERIES_NRF54LX || CLOCK_CONTROL_NRF_K32SRC_RC_CALIBRATION) && !SOC_SERIES_NRF54HX
	default CLOCK_CONTROL_NRF_CALIBRATION_PERIOD if CLOCK_CONTROL_NRF_K32SRC_RC_CALIBRATION
	default 4000
	help
	  This configuration means how often the calibration callback to mpsl is called.
	  On 54L, this still needs to be called even if LFRC is not used.
