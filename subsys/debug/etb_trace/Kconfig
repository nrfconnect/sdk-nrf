	  Tracing requires the debug system in the SoC to be enabled, which increases overall
	  power consumption by several mA.
	  Enabling this option will reduce the power consumption by disabling tracing when the
	  CPU is about to go to idle for a period longer than
	  CONFIG_ETB_TRACE_LOW_POWER_MIN_IDLE_TIME_MS.
	  Enabling this option will introduce latency to the system, as it will run code both
	  when entering and exiting idle, including when entering ISRs.
	  It may also have other unknown side effects to the system behavior.
