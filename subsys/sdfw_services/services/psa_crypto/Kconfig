		all PSA [inout] and [out] structures that are not aligned to the DCache DataUnit size.
		When this option is disabled, the PSA Crypto service will never use bounce buffers,
		and the application must ensure that the structures are cache-safe.
		The structures are cache-safe if there are no writes locally to any of the DataUnits
		that contain the structure getting written from the remote.
