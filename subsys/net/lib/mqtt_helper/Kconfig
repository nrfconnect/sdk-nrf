menuconfig MQTT_HELPER
	bool "MQTT helper library"
	select NET_SOCKETS_POSIX_NAMES if !POSIX_API
	select MQTT_LIB
	help
	  Convenience library that simplifies Zephyr MQTT API and socket handling.

if MQTT_HELPER

config MQTT_HELPER_NATIVE_TLS
	bool "Native TLS socket"
	help
	  Enabling this option will configure the socket to be native for TLS
	  instead of offloading TLS operations to the device's networking stack.

config MQTT_HELPER_PORT
	int "MQTT broker port"
	default 8883 if MQTT_LIB_TLS
	default 1883
	help
	  Port number to connect to the MQTT broker.

config MQTT_HELPER_SEC_TAG
	int "TLS sec tag"
	depends on MQTT_LIB_TLS
	default -1
	help
	  Security tag where TLS credentials are stored.

config MQTT_HELPER_SEND_TIMEOUT
	bool "Send data with socket timeout"
	default y
	help
	  Configures a timeout on the MQTT socket to ensure that a call to the send
	  function will not block indefinitely. To configure the length of the timeout,
	  use MQTT_HELPER_SEND_TIMEOUT_SEC.

config MQTT_HELPER_SEND_TIMEOUT_SEC
	int "Send timeout"
	depends on MQTT_HELPER_SEND_TIMEOUT
	default 60
	help
	  Timeout in seconds to use when the MQTT socket is configured to
	  send with a timeout by enabling MQTT_HELPER_SEND_TIMEOUT.

config MQTT_HELPER_STATIC_IP_ADDRESS
	string "Static IP address"
	help
	  Set a static IP address to use when connecting to the MQTT broker.
	  Leave the string empty to use DNS to resolve the IoT Hub hostname instead.

config MQTT_HELPER_SECONDARY_SEC_TAG
	int "Secondary TLS sec tag"
	default -1
	help
	  Security tag where TLS credentials are stored.
	  The secondary tag can be used to store for instance an additional server certificate.
	  -1 indicates that the secondary sec tag is not used.

config MQTT_HELPER_STACK_SIZE
	int "Connection thread stack size"
	default 2560
	help
	  The stack size of the internal thread in the library.
	  The thread polls the MQTT socket while it's open.
	  All MQTT-related callbacks happen in context of this thread, so the stack size may have
	  to be adjusted for your needs.

config MQTT_HELPER_RX_TX_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Buffer sizes for the MQTT library"
	default 256
	help
	  Specifies maximum message size can be transmitted/received through
	  MQTT (exluding MQTT PUBLISH payload).

config MQTT_HELPER_PAYLOAD_BUFFER_LEN
	int "Size of the MQTT PUBLISH payload buffer (receiving MQTT messages)"
	default 2048 if NRF_MODEM_LIB
	default 4096

	default y
	imply MBEDTLS_PEM_CERTIFICATE_FORMAT if MBEDTLS
	help
	  Enable run-time provisioning of certificates from the
	  certificates header file selected by using MQTT_HELPER_CERTIFICATES_FILE
	  This option is only available for emulation build targets,
	  such as QEMU x86 or Native Posix.
	  This option is only intended for testing and should not be used in a production scenario.
	  Enabling this option means that the credentials used in the TLS communication towards the
	  server will be exposed in flash memory.

config MQTT_HELPER_CERTIFICATES_FILE
	string "TLS certificates"
	depends on MQTT_HELPER_PROVISION_CERTIFICATES
	default "../cert/mqtt-certs.h"
	help
	  The default path for a header file that contains definitions for certificates that are
	  used during run-time provisioning of TLS credentials.
	  By default, the library expects the credentials to be in
	  Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format. See "mqtt-certs.h" for a template.

config MQTT_HELPER_LAST_WILL
	bool "Last will"
	help
	  If this option is set a configurable last will topic and message is
	  provided by the device in the MQTT CONNECT message. Upon a disconnect
	  from the MQTT broker the broker will publish the last will message
	  to the last will topic.
