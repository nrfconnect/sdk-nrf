	  Non confirmable requests are usually used to send data to the cloud
	  for which it is OK if it is sometimes lost. A value of 0 means it is
	  acceptable if no response is received from the cloud. Non-zero values
	  result in up to this number of retransmissions of the request followed
	  by waits for a response.

	  The nRF Cloud Wi-Fi location service does not require the human-
	  readable SSIDs in order to determine the device location. It does
	  require the access point MAC addresses. By not including SSIDs
	  the amount of data sent to the cloud is greatly reduced.
