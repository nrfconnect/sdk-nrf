config NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_REQUEST_ALL_UPON_INIT
	bool "Request all available P-GPS data upon initialization"
	default y
	help
	  If this option is enabled, all available P-GPS data will be requested from cloud when
	  the library is initialized given that no P-GPS data has previously been stored to flash.

config NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_PREDICTION_PERIOD
	int "Desired time in minutes between predictions."
	range 60 480
	default 240
	help
	  This value is used when requesting predicted GPS data from the
	  cloud. More frequent predictions will result in more accurate
	  ephemeris values for any given time, but will take more storage
	  space in flash.

config NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_NUM_PREDICTIONS
	int "Desired number of predictions."
	range 1 84
	default 42
	help
	  This value, together with the prediction period, determines the
	  overall timespan that the GPS predictions will cover. The
	  default values allows for one week of predictions.

config NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_REPLACEMENT_THRESHOLD
	int "Number of predictions remaining before fetching more."
	range 0 84
	default 0
	help
	  When set to 0, no attempt will be made to update the prediction
	  set from the cloud until all predictions have expired. When set
	  to an even number less than or equal to
	  NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_NUM_PREDICTIONS, any expired predictions will be
	  replaced with predictions following the last remaining valid
	  prediction. Odd numbers are not allowed.

config NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_DOWNLOAD_FRAGMENT_SIZE
	int "Fragment size for P-GPS downloads"
	range 128 1500
	default 1500
	help
	  Due to the finite size of the nrf9160 modem's TLS buffer, this
	  value needs to be small enough to leave room for the HTTP
	  headers.

config NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_TRANSPORT_NONE
	bool "No transport"
	help
	  Enabling this option will make the nRF Cloud P-GPS library not request
	  data from nRF Cloud when its APIs are called. This will instead let
	  it be up to the user to request, receive and process P-GPS data.

config NRF_CLOUD_PGPS_TRANSPORT_MQTT
	bool "MQTT transport"
	depends on NRF_CLOUD_MQTT
	help
	  Use nRF Cloud library's MQTT implementation to send requests for P-GPS
	  data and receive responses.
