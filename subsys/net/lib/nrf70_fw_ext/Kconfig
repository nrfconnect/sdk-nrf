	help
	  Enabling this option adds support for Device Firmware Update (DFU)
	  for the nRF70 Series Firmware Patch.

	  This feature requires the addition of an MCUBoot partition pair:
	  a primary and a secondary partition. These partitions are used to
	  store the new firmware patch. The specific partition numbers to be used
	  depend on the number of partitions already in use.

	  The "nrf70_wifi_fw" partition must be added to the newly created
	  MCUBoot primary partition. Once this Kconfig option is enabled,
	  the nRF70.hex file will be signed by MCUBoot. The signed image
	  will then be merged with the application image and flashed onto
	  the target board.

	  Ensure that the required MCUBoot partitions are properly configured
	  before enabling this option. Refer to the documentation for detailed
	  instructions on partition configuration and the DFU process.
