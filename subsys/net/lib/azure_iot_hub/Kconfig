	string "Azure IoT Hub hostname"
	help
	  Hostname to Azure IoT Hub instance.

	default 8883
	help
	  Port number to connect to on Azure IoT Hub instance.

	  the IoT Hub.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_DPS
	bool "Device Provisioning Service"
	select CJSON_LIB
	depends on SETTINGS
	help
	  Enabling DPS will make the device connect to the specified DPS
	  host name, provision the device and retrieve the IoT hub host name to
	  use.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_SEND_TIMEOUT
	bool "Send data with socket timeout"
	default y
	help
	  Configures a timeout on the Azure IoT Hub socket to ensure that a call to the send
	  function will not block indefinitely. To configure the length of the timeout,
	  use AZURE_IOT_HUB_SEND_TIMEOUT_SEC.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_STATIC_IP_ADDRESS
	string "Static IP address"
	help
	  Set a static IP address to use when connecting to Azure IoT Hub.
	  Leave the string empty to use DNS to resolve the IoT Hub hostname instead.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_NATIVE_TLS
	bool "Native TLS socket"
	help
	  Enabling this option will configure the socket to be native for TLS
	  instead of offloading TLS operations to the modem.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_PROVISION_CERTIFICATES
	bool "Run-time provisioning of certificates"
	default y if BOARD_QEMU_X86
	imply MBEDTLS_PEM_CERTIFICATE_FORMAT if MBEDTLS
	help
	  Enable run-time provisioning of certificates from the
	  certificates header file selected by using AZURE_IOT_HUB_CERTIFICATES_FILE
	  This option is only available for QEMU x86 build targets.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_CERTIFICATES_FILE
	string "Azure IoT Hub certificates"
	depends on AZURE_IOT_HUB_PROVISION_CERTIFICATES
	default "../include/azure-certs.h"
	help
	  The default path for a header file that contains definitions for certificates that are
	  used during run-time provisioning of TLS credentials.
	  By default, the library expects the credentials to be in
	  Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format. See "azure-certs.h" for a template.


config AZURE_IOT_HUB_SEND_TIMEOUT_SEC
	int "Send timeout"
	depends on AZURE_IOT_HUB_SEND_TIMEOUT
	default 60
	help
	  Timeout in seconds to use when the Azure IoT Hub socket is configured to
	  send with a timeout by enabling AZURE_IOT_HUB_SEND_TIMEOUT.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_USER_NAME_BUF_SIZE
	int "User name max length"
	default 128
	help
	  Maximum length of the user name.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_SECONDARY_SEC_TAG
	int "Secondary TLS sec tag"
	default -1
	help
	  Security tag where TLS credentials are stored.
	  The secondary tag can be used to store for instance an additional server certificate.
	  -1 indicates that the secondary sec tag is not used.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_MQTT_RX_TX_BUFFER_LEN
	int "Buffer sizes for the MQTT library"
	default 256
	help
	  Specifies maximum message size can be transmitted/received through
	  MQTT (exluding MQTT PUBLISH payload).

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_MQTT_PAYLOAD_BUFFER_LEN
	int "Size of the MQTT PUBLISH payload buffer (receiving MQTT messages)"
	default 2048 if NRF_MODEM_LIB
	default 4096

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_STACK_SIZE
	int "Connection thread stack size"
	default 2560
	help
	  The stack size of the internal thread in the library.
	  The thread polls the MQTT socket while it's open.
	  All MQTT-related callbacks happen in context of this thread, so the stack size may have
	  to be adjusted for your needs.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_TOPIC_MAX_LEN
	int "Max length of topic"
	default 100
	help
	  Sets the maximum length of a topic. If you plan to use message properties,
	  it should be considered to increase this value to fit the topic into the allocated
	  buffers.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_MSG_PROPERTY_RECV_MAX_COUNT
	int "Maximum number of property bag elements"
	default 3
	help
	  The maximum number of message properties that can be parsed from a topic in an incoming
	  MQTT message.
	  Increasing this value will increase stack usage when parsing topics,
	  and vice versa if decreasing it.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_MSG_PROPERTY_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Message property buffer size"
	default 128
	help
	  Message properties are converted to a string before sending to Azure. This option
	  can be used to configure the buffer size for the property string. The buffer is
	  allocated on the stack, so it's beneficial to reduce it if message properties will not
	  be used for device-originated messages.


if AZURE_IOT_HUB_DPS

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_DPS_ID_SCOPE
	string "DPS ID scope"
	help

	  Hostname for the DPS instance to use.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_DPS_TIMEOUT_SEC
	int "DPS timeout"
	default 90
	help
	  Timeout in seconds for device provisioning. If the device has not been assigned within
	  the timeout, the provisioning attempt is terminated.
	  This timeout is useful if the device can't reach the server and vice versa in the middle
	  of the registration process.
	  The timer is reset on every incoming MQTT message from the server.
	  Note the difference between this timeout and AZURE_IOT_HUB_SEND_TIMEOUT, which only
	  affects send() calls.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_DPS_HOSTNAME_MAX_LEN
	int "Azure IoT Hub name max length"
	default 64
	help
	  Maximum length for IoT Hub hostname.

	  The buffer can be adjusted depending on the registration ID length and expected operation ID length.
	  The operation ID is received from DPS after registration request is sent.

config AZURE_IOT_HUB_DPS_USER_NAME_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "User name buffer size"
	default 256
