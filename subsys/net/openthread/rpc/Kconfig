config OPENTHREAD_RPC_DNS_MAX_TXT_DATA_SIZE
	int "Maximum size of TXT data that can be serialized by DNS API"
	default 255
	help
	  During serialization of a service information the server must allocate
	  a stack allocated buffer for storing TXT data. This value controls the
	  buffer size.

choice OPENTHREAD_RPC_ROLE_CHOICE
	prompt "OpenThread over RPC role selection"
	default OPENTHREAD_RPC_CLIENT
	help
	  Selects the device role for OpenThread over RPC. The default role is
	  a client role.

config OPENTHREAD_RPC_CLIENT
	bool "OpenThread over RPC client"
	help
	  Enables OpenThread over RPC client role that uses nRF RPC library to
	  invoke OpenThread functions on the remote core.

config OPENTHREAD_RPC_SERVER
	bool "OpenThread over RPC server"
	depends on NET_L2_OPENTHREAD || ZTEST
	help
	  Enables OpenThread over RPC server role that runs the full OpenThread
	  stack and exposes OpenThread functions using nRF RPC library to a client
	  running on the remote core.

config OPENTHREAD_RPC_NET_IF
	bool "OpenThread over RPC network interface"
	default y
	depends on NETWORKING
	help
	  Enables OpenThread RPC commands for sending and receiving IPv6 packets
	  to/from the OpenThread stack. For the RPC client role, it additionally
	  creates a Zephyr network interface that employs these commands.

	help
	  Defines the number of slots for storing a callback along with its context
	  for ongoing CoAP requests awaiting a response.

config OPENTHREAD_RPC_CLIENT_RADIO_TIME_REFRESH_PERIOD
	int "Radio time sync period [s]"
	default 30
	help
	  Defines how frequently the RPC client shall read the RPC server's
	  radio time instead of extrapolating it from the last reading and the
	  current local time. The purpose of this setting is to reduce the RPC
	  traffic given that otLinkRawGetRadioTime() may be used extensively by
	  the application.
