	  flash partition. Note that enabling this option may significantly increase
	  the flash wear, so this option is not meant the production environments,
	  and extra caution should be taken when using this functionality.

	  Enables saving the crash log in the "crash_log" retained RAM partition,
	  and adds an nRF RPC command that allows a remote user to read the crash
	  log after the device reboots.
	  The crash log contains any log messages passed to the nRF RPC logging
	  backend after the logging subsystem has been put in the panic mode.
	  Setting this option requires that the devicetree contains the "crash_log"
	  retained RAM partition.

config LOG_BACKEND_RPC_ECHO
	bool "Echo command support"
	help
	  Enables the support for "echo" nRF RPC command that allows the remote to
	  generate a log message on the local device. This can be used for testing
	  Logging over RPC functionality.
