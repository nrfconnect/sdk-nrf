	int "Offset at which to store validation metadata."
	default 0
	help
	  Must be either 0 or larger than the size of the application. If 0,
	  the metadata is appended directly after the application image,
	  aligned to the closest word.

config FW_INFO_OFFSET
	hex "The location of firmware info inside this firmware."
	default 0x200
	help
	  The location of firmware information inside the current firmware
	  image. Valid values are 0x200, 0x400 and 0x800. Compatible readers
	  of firmware information should search all possible offsets. Note
	  that all space between the vector table and this address is unused.

	int "Version number of the firmware."
	default 1

config FW_INFO_MAGIC_COMMON
	hex "Magic word for all structs (32 bits)."
	default 0x281ee6de
	help
	  This is used by different metadata structs (in fw_info.h and
	  elsewhere). They each have their own magic word composed of three
	  u32_t values, where one is always this option (FW_INFO_MAGIC_COMMON).
	  One of the u32_ts is a compatibility ID constructed from
	  FW_INFO_HARDWARE_ID, FW_INFO_VERSION, FW_CRYPTO_ID, and
	  FW_INFO_MAGIC_COMPATIBILITY_ID, while the final u32_t is completely
	  different for each struct, e.g. FW_INFO_MAGIC_FIRMWARE_INFO.
	  The bootloader expects a certain value for each struct, and if it
	  attempts to read a struct without a matching magic word, the struct
	  will be rejected. The config values here apply both to this build of
	  the bootloader and to the metadata constructed for the app.
	  Refer to this module's CMakeLists.txt to see how the magic words are
	  composed.

config FW_INFO_MAGIC_FIRMWARE_INFO
	hex "Magic word for firmware information structs (32 bits)."
	default 0x8fcebb4c
	help
	  Magic word value specific to firmware information structs (inside
	  the firmware). For more information, see FW_INFO_MAGIC_COMMON.

config FW_INFO_MAGIC_EXT_API
	hex "Magic word for EXT_API structs (32 bits)."
	default 0xb845acea
	help
	  Magic word value specific to EXT_API structs.
	  For more information, see FW_INFO_MAGIC_COMMON.

	help
	  User defined value.
	  Used to ensure compatibility between bootloader and metadata.
	  For more information, see FW_INFO_MAGIC_COMMON.

config FW_INFO_MAGIC_LEN
	int
	default 12

	  Total length of magic words (in bytes).
