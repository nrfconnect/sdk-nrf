	  The PSA core with tiny footprint is created to be used e.g. for bootloader
	  or similar use cases where there are severe size restrictions. This PSA core
	  will only provide limited algorithm support and a limited amount of features
	  from the PSA Crypto key management APIs. Note that the volatile key-store is
	  not possible to use. Also note that PSA core lite is not thread-safe.

	depends on PSA_CORE_LITE
	help
	  This configuration calls low-level APIs in CRACEN for Ed25519 instead of
	  going through PSA crypto driver wrappers APIs. This optimization limits
	  supported algorithms for signature verification to only Pure Ed25519 and
	  Ed25519ph.
