config CAF_FORCE_POWER_DOWN_EVENTS
	bool "Enable force Power down event"
	help
	  Enable power manager event to put the device into power down mode when processed.
	  It means the power down would be processed without the delay that is
	  normally applied inside power manager.
	  The event would be send only if the power manager is in IDLE state.
	  The power down event would be send ignoring the fact if any of the modules
	  requires ACTIVE state.
	  The reasult of such situation would be powering down the device to SUSPENDED state.
	  To avoid this the user is responsible in clearing all power ACTIVE requirements
	  before sending this event.
	  The event is here to support very specyfic requirement when the device
	  has to limit is power usage no matter what.
	  The possible usage scenarios are:
	  - Reaction to USB SUSPEND on bus powered device
	  - Reaction to power loss if we have for example to disable LEDs to keep power
	    to do some important jobs before we lost all the power stored in system.
