	  Module that enables Bluetooth, handles Zephyr's connection callbacks,
	  propagates information about the connection state and parameters by
	  using Application Event Manager events and exchanges GATT MTU on GATT
	  Client.

	  Automatically request connection encryption right after the connection is established.

	default 1
	help
	  The available Bluetooth bonds are shared among Bluetooth local
	  identities. Limiting number of bonds allowed per local identity
	  prevents from situation where one local identity uses too many bonds.
	  In that case, other local identities may be unable to bond.

	  This enables small module that keeps track on active connections.
	  If there is any active connection the power down modes would be limited to SUSPENDED.
	  Full POWER OFF mode would be only allowed if we have no active connection.

	help
	  LLPM is a proprietary Bluetooth extension from Nordic Semiconductor. It is designed for
	  applications in which the interface response time is critical for the user. It introduces
	  the possibility to reduce the connection interval to 1 ms for one link. LLPM parameters
	  can be used for a given connection only if it's supported by both peripheral and central.
