	help
	  Device will use direct advertising if bonded. The device will not advertise directly
	  towards a central that uses Resolvable Private Address (RPA). The module does not read
	  the Central Address Resolution GATT characteristic of the central, so it does not know
	  if the remote device supports the address resolution of directed advertisements.

	help
	  Device will initially advertise with shorter interval to enable quicker discovery by
	  hosts. After this time it will shift to normal cadence advertising.

	bool "Enable Swift Pair feature"
	depends on CAF_BLE_ADV_FAST_ADV
	help
	  Enable quick pairing with Microsoft Swift Pair. Make sure to add Swift Pair data to
	  advertising packets used by your device when it's not bonded. The Swift Pair data
	  must be added as the last member of advertising data.

	  To ensure users will not try to connect to a device which is no longer available,
	  Swift Pair vendor section will be removed before exiting from advertising mode.
