menuconfig BT_ENOCEAN
	bool "EnOcean library"
	depends on BT_OBSERVER
	depends on BT_HOST_CCM
	help
	  The EnOcean library implements support for commissioning and observing
	  of BLE enabled EnOcean devices, such as the PTM 215B Pushbutton
	  transmitter module.

if BT_ENOCEAN

config BT_ENOCEAN_DEVICES_MAX
	int "Maximum number of EnOcean devices"
	range 1 999
	default 1
	help
	  This value defines the maximum number of EnOcean devices this library
	  can manage at a time. Each device requires about 30 bytes of RAM.

menuconfig BT_ENOCEAN_STORE
	bool "Store EnOcean device data persistently"
	depends on BT_SETTINGS
	default y
	help
	  Stores all commissioned devices persistently, including periodic
	  samples of the device sequence number.

if BT_ENOCEAN_STORE

menuconfig BT_ENOCEAN_STORE_SEQ
	bool "Continuously store the EnOcean sequence number"
	default y
	help
	  Defines whether the sequence numbers of incoming EnOcean packets
	  should be stored persistently. The sequence number is used in
	  replay attack protection, and unless it is stored, third parties
	  will be able to replay EnOcean messages after a power cycle.

if BT_ENOCEAN_STORE_SEQ

config BT_ENOCEAN_STORE_TIMEOUT
	int "Delay (in seconds) before storing EnOcean data persistently"
	range 0 10000000
	default 5
	help
	  This parameter controls the duration of the write delay.
	  Whenever new EnOcean data is received, the library will start a timer
	  that stores the sequence number when it expires. Reducing this timer
	  shortens the timespan in which attackers could replay a message, but
	  increases the wear on the storage medium.

config BT_ENOCEAN_DEBUG
	bool "Enable debug logs"
	depends on BT_DEBUG
	help
	  Use this option to enable debug logs for the Bluetooth
	  Enocean functionality.
