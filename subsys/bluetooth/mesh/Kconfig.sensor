config BT_MESH_SENSOR_USE_LEGACY_SENSOR_VALUE
	bool "Use legacy sensor_value in Sensor APIs"
	default y if BT_MESH_SENSOR
	select DEPRECATED
	help
	  Enables the legacy Sensor APIs using sensor_value for sensor
	  value representation. If this is not selected, the APIs will use
	  bt_mesh_sensor_value for representation which can accurately represent
	  any raw sensor value. This option is deprecated and will be removed in
	  a future version.

config BT_MESH_SENSOR_LABELS
	bool "Enable Sensor labels"
	help
	  Controls the availability of sensor labels for channels and units

config BT_MESH_SENSOR_ALL_TYPES
	bool "Force all sensor types to be known"
	default y if BT_MESH_SENSOR_CLI
	help
	  Forces all sensor types to be included in the build. This is
	  useful if the set of sensor types that will be used is unknown at
	  compile time, but increases ROM usage by about 3.5kB (4kB if labels
	  are enabled).

config BT_MESH_SENSOR_CHANNELS_MAX
	int "Max sensor channels"
	default 5
	help
	  Max number of channels in a single sensor. Matches the largest known
	  number by default.

config BT_MESH_SENSOR_CHANNEL_ENCODED_SIZE_MAX
	int "Max sensor channel encoded length"
	default 4
	help
	  Longest encoded representation of a single sensor channel.
	  Matches the largest known size by default.
