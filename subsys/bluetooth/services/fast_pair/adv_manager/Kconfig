	  Enable the Fast Pair advertising module. The module manages the Fast Pair advertising set
	  and the Fast Pair connections that are derived from it.

	  Tailor the advertising manager for the specific Fast Pair device type. The use case
	  configuration enables additional behaviour to satisfy the device feature requirements
	  from the Google Fast Pair specification that are related to Fast Pair advertising:
	  https://developers.google.com/nearby/fast-pair/specifications/devicefeaturerequirement.

config BT_FAST_PAIR_ADV_MANAGER_USE_CASE_UNSPECIFIED
	bool "Unspecified use case"
	help
	  Select the unspecified Fast Pair use case. This use case configuration is neutral and is
	  the default choice selection. The unspecified use case configuration allows using the
	  module in the minimal configuration without any use case specific behaviours. This
	  configuration choice should be used in all use cases that do not define any additional
	  requirements for the Fast Pair advertising. It can also be used to replace the suggested
	  implementation of use case specific advertising requirements with custom implementation.
	  For example, if the locator tag extension of this module does not fit your application
	  due to its underlying assumption, you can desist from enabling the
	  CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_ADV_MANAGER_USE_CASE_LOCATOR_TAG Kconfig option and replace it with
	  you custom implementation.

config BT_FAST_PAIR_ADV_MANAGER_USE_CASE_LOCATOR_TAG
	bool "Locator tag use case"
	depends on BT_FAST_PAIR_FMDN
	help
	  Tailor the advertising manager for the Fast Pair locator tag. The manager implements the
	  locator tag requirements for the Fast Pair advertising defined in the FMDN specification:
	  https://developers.google.com/nearby/fast-pair/specifications/extensions/fmdn#locator-tag.

	  The locator tag extension currently controls the following advertising triggers:

	  - FMDN provisioning trigger: used to maintain the Fast Pair advertising between the
	    the Owner Account Key write operation until successful provisioning operation.
	  - Clock synchronization trigger: used to maintain the Fast Pair advertising for the
	    FMDN clock synchronization; this trigger can be disabled with the
	    CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_ADV_MANAGER_USE_CASE_LOCATOR_TAG_CLOCK_SYNC_TRIGGER Kconfig option
	    and replaced with custom implementation.

	help
	  Activate the advertising trigger that is responsible for the FMDN clock
	  synchronization. After a power loss in the FMDN provisoned state, the trigger
	  keeps the Fast Pair non-discoverable advertising active until the next invocation
	  of Read Beacon Parameters request. This additional advertising state lets the Fast
	  Pair Seeker (for example, a smartphone) detect the device and synchronize the clock
	  even if a significant clock drift occurred. This Kconfig option is responsible for
	  implementing clock synchronization requirement from the Locator Tag guidelines:
	  https://developers.google.com/nearby/fast-pair/specifications/extensions/fmdn#locator-tag.
