	  The Vendor ID Source field designates which organization assigned the value used in the Vendor ID field value.
	  The possible values are:
	  - 1 Bluetooth SIG, the Vendor ID was assigned by the Bluetooth SIG
	  - 2 USB IF, the Vendor ID was assigned by the USB IF

	  The Vendor ID field is intended to uniquely identify the vendor of the device.
	  This field is used in conjunction with Vendor ID Source field,
	  which determines which organization assigned the Vendor ID field value.
	  Note: The Bluetooth Special Interest Group assigns Device ID Vendor ID,
	  and the USB Implementer’s Forum assigns Vendor IDs,
	  either of which can be used for the Vendor ID field value.
	  Device providers should procure the Vendor ID from the USB Implementer’s Forum
	  or the Company Identifier from the Bluetooth SIG.

config NRF_BT_PNP_PRODUCT_ID
	hex "Product ID"

	  The Product ID field is intended to distinguish between different products made by the vendor
	  identified with the Vendor ID field. The vendors themselves manage Product ID field values.

config NRF_BT_PNP_PRODUCT_VER
	hex "Product Version"
	range 0 0xFFFF
	default 1
	help
	  The Product Version field is a numeric expression identifying the device release number in Binary-Coded Decimal.
	  This is a vendor-assigned value, which defines the version of the product identified by the Vendor ID and Product ID fields.
	  This field is intended to differentiate between versions of products with identical Vendor IDs and Product IDs.
	  The value of the field value is 0xJJMN for version JJ.M.N
	  (JJ – major version number, M – minor version number, N – sub-minor version number);
	  e.g., version 2.1.3 is represented with value 0x0213 and version 2.0.0 is represented with a value of 0x0200.
	  When upward-compatible changes are made to the device, it is recommended that the minor version number be incremented.
	  If incompatible changes are made to the device, it is recommended that the major version number be incremented.
	  The sub-minor version is incremented for bug fixes.
