	  Number of concurrent slave roles defines how many simultaneous
	  connections can be created with the device working as a slave.
	  NOTE: the number of master roles is defined as
	  BT_MAX_CONN - BLECTRL_SLAVE_COUNT

	help
	  The time set aside for connections on every connection interval in
	  microseconds. The event length and the connection interval are the
	  primary parameters for setting the throughput of a connection.
