	  Sets the max number of antenna paths the controller supports.
	  The number of antenna paths used during channel sounding
	  depends on the tone antenna configuration index selected in the procedure parameters.
	  For instance, an A2_B2 configuration requires four antenna paths.
	  Reducing the value of this kconfig will reduce the RAM usage per CS context.

	  Set the preferred tone length (T_PM) of CS tones

	  In Channel Sounding, tones in step mode-2 and -3 have a length of t_pm microseconds.
	  T_PM can be 10, 20 or 40 microseconds.

	  Since the T_PM can affect the quality of tone measurements, it is important for
	  certain use-cases to be able to set a preferred T_PM. The controller will then use
	  this value when the LE CS Create Config command is issued.

	  If the local or peer device does not support the suggested preferred T_PM, it cannot
	  be used. The controller will then select a T_PM value supported by both local and
	  peer devices when the LE CS Create Config command is issued.
