# The following lines should be used instead of lines 26+ and we should use the official Vale
# GitHub Action hook from https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action?tab=readme-ov-file.
# However, Nordic Semiconductor GitHub policy does not allow us to use third party actions that
# are not part of GitHub's default action library. The following lines are commented out and kept
# for reference and potential future use.
