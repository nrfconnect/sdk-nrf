# udev rules which allow using configuration channel for nRF52 Desktop without
# root permissions on Linux. Adapted from HIDAPI project.
#
# Symbolic links are only used for identification of attached devices and
# checking if the rule has been applied correctly. Can be removed if not needed.

# To apply the rule, drop this file into `/etc/udev/rules.d` and unplug
# and replug your device. These are the only steps necessary to see the new
# permissions. You do not need to restart udev.

# Rules change the permissions to 0666 (world readable/writable) for specified
# device on Linux systems.
