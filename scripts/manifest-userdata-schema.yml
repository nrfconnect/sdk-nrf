# A pykwalify schema for the 'userdata' fields in nrf/west.yml.
# We check this in CI to make sure that the data are valid for use
# in our NCS west extensions (see west_commands in this same directory
# or run 'west help' for more on those).
#
# If you change this, you must also update doc/nrf/dm_code_base.rst.
