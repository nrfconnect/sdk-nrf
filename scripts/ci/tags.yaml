# This file contains information on what files are associated with which
# twister tag.
#
# File format
# ###########
#
# "tag" (the quotes are only needed for titles with special characters,
#  like colons):
#     files:
#         List of paths and/or glob patterns giving the files in the tag,
#         relative to the root directory.
#
#         If a path or glob pattern ends in a '/', it matches all files within
#         the given directory or directories. Otherwise, an exact match is
#         required.
#
#         Paths to directories should always have a trailing '/'.
#
#     files-regex:
#         List of regular expressions applied to paths to determine if they
#         belong to the tag. The regular expression may match anywhere within
#         the path, but can be anchored with ^ and $ as usual.
#
#         Can be combined with a 'files' key.
#
#         Note: Prefer plain 'files' patterns where possible. get_maintainer.py
#         will check that they match some file, but won't check regexes
#         (because it might be slow).
#
#     files-exclude:
#         Like 'files', but any matching files will be excluded from the tag.
#
#     files-regex-exclude:
#         Like 'files-regex', but any matching files will be excluded from the
#         tag.
#
# All tags must have a 'files' and/or 'files-regex' key.

# 1. Avoid putting include/ in entries as any include/ change we want
#    to get test coverage as broad as possible.
# 2. Keep tag entries sorted alphabetically
# 3. The root folder for listed paths here is NCS,
#    thus files from sdk-nrf starts from nrf, from sdk-zephyr: zephyr,
#    from sdk-mcuboot: bootloader/mcuboot etc.
#    Paths should match location after checking out sdk-nrf (+ west update)
